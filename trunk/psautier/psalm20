Psalm 20(19) Exaudiat te Dominus

2 May the Lord answer in time of trial;
may the name of Jacob's God protect you.

3 May he send you help from his shrine
and give you support from Zion.
4 May he remember all your offerings
and receive your sacrifice with favor.

5 May he give you your heart's desire
and fulfill every one of your plans.
6 May we ring out our joy at your victory
and rejoice in the name of our God.
(May the Lord grant all your prayers.)

7 I am sure now that the Lord
will give victory to his anointed,
will reply from his holy heaven
with the mighty victory of his hand.

8 Some trust in chariots or horses,
but we in the name of the Lord.
9 They will collapse and fall,
but we shall hold and stand firm.

10 Give victory to the king, O Lord,
give answer on the day we call.
