Psalm 25(24) Ad te, Domine, levavi

1 To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
2 I trust you, let me not be disappointed;
do not let my enemies triumph.
3 Those who hope in you shall not be disappointed,
but only those who wantonly break faith.

4 Lord, make me know your ways.
Lord, teach me your paths.
5 Make me walk in your truth, and teach me:
for you are God my savior.

In you I hope all day long
7c because of your goodness, O Lord.
6 Remember your mercy, Lord,
and the love you have shown from of old.
7 Do not remember the sins of my youth.
In your love remember me.

8 The Lord is good and upright.
He shows the path to those who stray,
9 He guides the humble in the right path,
He teaches his way to the poor.

10 His ways are faithfulness and love
for those who keep his covenant and law.
11 Lord, for the sake of your name
forgive my guilt, for it is great.

12 If anyone fears the Lord
he will show him the path he should choose.
13 His soul shall live in happiness
and his children shall possess the land.
14 The Lord's friendship is for those who revere him;
to them he reveals his covenant.

15 My eyes are always on the Lord;
for he rescues my feet from the snare.
16 Turn to me and have mercy
for I am lonely and poor.

17 Relieve the anguish of my heart
and set me free from my distress.
18 See my affliction and my toil
and take all my sins away.

19 See how many are my foes;
how violent their hatred for me.
20 Preserve my life and rescue me.
Do not disappoint me, you are my refuge.
21 May innocence and uprightness protect me:
for my hope is in you, O Lord.

22 Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress.
