Psalm 14(13) Dixit insipiens

1 The fool has said in his heart:
"There is no God above."
Their deeds are corrupt, depraved;
not a good man is left.

2 From heaven the Lord looks down
on the sons of men
to see if any are wise,
if any seek God.

3 All have left the right path,
depraved, every one;
there is not a good man left,
no, not even one.

4 Will the evil-doers not understand?
They eat up my people
as though they were eating bread:
they never pray to the Lord.

5 See how they tremble with fear
without cause for fear:
for God is with the just.
6 You may mock the poor man's hope,
but his refuge is the Lord.

7 O that Israel's salvation might come from Zion!
When the Lord delivers his people from bondage,
then Jacob will be glad and Israel rejoice.
