Psalm 28(27) Ad te Domine

1 To you, O Lord, I call,
my rock, hear me.
If you do not heed I shall become
like those in the grave.

2 Hear the voice of my pleading
as I call for help,
as I lift up my hands in prayer
to your holy place.

3 Do not drag me away with the wicked,
with the evil-doers,
who speak words of peace to their neighbors
but with evil in their hearts.

4 Repay them as their actions deserve
and the malice of their deeds.
Repay them for the works of their hands;
give them their desserts.
5 For they ignore the deeds of the Lord
and the work of his hands.
(May he ruin them and never rebuild them.)

6 Blessed be Lord for he has heard
my cry, my appeal.
7 The Lord is my strength and my shield;
in him my heart trusts.
I was helped, my heart rejoices
and I praise him with my song.

8 The Lord is the strength of his people,
a fortress where his anointed find salvation.
9 Save your people; bless Israel your heritage.
Be their shepherd and carry them for ever.
