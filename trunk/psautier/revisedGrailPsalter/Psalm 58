Psalm 58

2 Do you truly speak justice, you who hold divine power?
Do you mete out fair judgment to the sons of men?
3 No, in your hearts you devise iniquities;
your hands deal out violence to the land.

4 The wicked go astray from the womb;
deviant from birth, they speak lies.
5 Their venom is like the venom of the snake;
they are like a deaf viper stopping its ears,
6 lest it should hear the snake-charmer’s voice,
the voice of the skillful dealer in spells.

7 O God, break the teeth in their mouths;
tear out the fangs of these lions, O Lord!
8 Let them vanish like water that runs away;
let them wither like grass that is trodden underfoot.
9 Let them be like the snail that dissolves into slime,
like a woman’s miscarriage that never sees the sun.

10 Before they put forth thorns, like a bramble,
let them be swept away, green wood or dry!
11 The just shall rejoice at the sight of vengeance;
they shall bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.
12 People shall say: “Truly, there is reward for the upright.
Truly there is a God who judges justly on earth.”
