Psalm 5

2 To my words give ear, O Lord;
give heed to my sighs.
3 Attend to the sound of my cry,
my King and my God.

4 To you do I pray, O Lord.
In the morning you hear my voice;
in the morning I plead and watch before you.

5 You are no God who delights in evil;
no sinner is your guest.
6 The boastful shall not stand their ground
before your eyes.

7 All who do evil you despise;
all who lie you destroy.
The deceitful and those who shed blood,
the Lord detests.

8 Yet through the greatness of your merciful love,
I enter your house.
I bow down before your holy temple,
in awe of you.

9 Lead me, Lord, in your justice,
because of my foes;
make straight your way before me.

10 No truth can be found in their mouths,
their heart is all malice,
their throat a wide-open grave;
with their tongue they flatter.

11 Declare them guilty, O God.
Let them fail in their designs.
Drive them out for their many transgressions,
for against you have they rebelled.

12 All who take refuge in you shall be glad,
and ever cry out their joy.
You shelter them; in you they rejoice,
those who love your name.
13 It is you who bless the just one, O Lord; 
you surround him with your favor like a shield.

Now and forever. Amen.
