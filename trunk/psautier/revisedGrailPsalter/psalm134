Psalm 119:113-120

113 I detest those with a divided heart,
but I love your law.
114 You are my hiding place, my shield;
I hope in your word.

115 Depart from me, you who do evil;
I will keep my Godâ€™s commands.
116 Uphold me by your promise; I shall live.
Let my hopes not be in vain.

117 Bear me up and I shall be saved,
and ever muse on your statutes.
118 You spurn all who stray from your statutes;
their cunning is in vain.

119 You regard the wicked like dross,
so I love your decrees.
120 My flesh trembles in terror before you;
I fear your judgments.

Now and forever. Amen.
