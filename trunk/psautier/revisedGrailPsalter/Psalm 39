Psalm 39

2 I said, “I will be watchful of my ways,
for fear I should sin with my tongue.
I will put a curb on my lips
when the wicked man stands before me.”
3 I was mute, silent, very still,
as my pain became intense.

4 My heart was burning within me.
At the thought of it, the fire blazed up,
and my tongue burst into speech:
5 “O Lord, you have shown me my end,
how short is the length of my days.
Now I know how fleeting is my life.

6 How short the span of days you have given me;
my life is as nothing in your sight.
Surely all mankind stands as but a breath.
7 A man surely lives as a shadow,
surely the riches he hoards, a mere breath;
he does not know who will gather them.”

8 And now, Lord, what is there to wait for?
In you rests all my hope.
9 Set me free from all my sins;
do not make me the taunt of the fool.
10 I was silent, not opening my lips,
because this was all your doing.

11 Take away your scourge from me.
I am crushed by the blows of your hand.
12 With rebukes you correct the sinner;
like a moth you devour all he treasures.
All mankind is no more than a breath.

13 O Lord, give heed to my prayer;
turn your ear to my cry;
do not be deaf to my weeping.
Behold, I am a stranger to you,
a pilgrim, like all my forebears.

14 Look away from me that I may smile
before I depart to be no more.
