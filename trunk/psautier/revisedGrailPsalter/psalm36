Psalm 36

2 Transgression speaks to the sinner
in the depths of his heart.
There is no fear of God
before his eyes.

3 In his own eyes, he flatters himself,
not to see and detest his own guilt.
4 The words of his mouth are mischief and deceit.
He has ceased to be prudent and do good.

5 In bed he plots iniquity.
He sets his foot on every wicked way;
no evil does he reject.

6 Your mercy, Lord, reaches to heaven,
your truth to the clouds.
7 Your justice is like Godâ€™s mountains;
like the great deep, your justice.
Both man and beast you save, O Lord.

8 How precious is your mercy, O God!
The children of men seek shelter 
in the shadow of your wings.

9 They feast on the riches of your house;
you give them drink from the stream of your delight.
10 For with you is the fountain of life,
and in your light we see light.

11 Maintain your mercy for those who know you,
your saving justice to upright hearts.
12 Let the foot of the proud not tread on me
nor the hand of the wicked drive me out.
13 There have the evildoers fallen;
flung down, unable to rise!

Now and forever. Amen.
