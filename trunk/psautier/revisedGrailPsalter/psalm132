Psalm 119:97-104

97 O Lord, how I love your law:
my meditation all the day!
98 Your command makes me wiser than my foes,
for it is with me always.

99 I have more insight than all who teach me,
for I ponder your decrees.
10 0 I have gained more understanding than my elders,
for I keep your precepts.

101 I keep my feet from every evil path,
to obey your word.
102 I have not turned away from your decrees,
which you yourself have taught me.

103 How sweet is your promise to my tongue,
more than honey in the mouth.
104 I gain understanding from your precepts,
and so I hate all false ways.

Now and forever. Amen.
