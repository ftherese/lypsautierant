Psalm 76

2 God is renowned in Judah;
in Israel his name is great.
3 His tent is set in Salem,
and his dwelling place in Sion.
4 It was there he broke the flaming arrows,
the shield, the sword, the armor.

5 Resplendent are you, more majestic
than the everlasting mountains.
6 The stouthearted, despoiled, slept in death;
none of the soldiers could lift a hand.
7 At your threat, O God of Jacob,
horse and rider lay stunned.

8 You, you alone, strike terror.
Who can stand in your presence,
against the might of your wrath?

9 You uttered your sentence from the heavens;
the earth in terror was still
10 when you arose, O God, to judge,
to save all the humble of the earth.

11 For the rage of man only serves to praise you;
you surround yourself with the survivors of wrath.
12 Make vows to the Lord your God and fulfill them.
Let all around him pay tribute to the One who strikes terror,
13 who cuts short the breath of princes,
who strikes terror in the kings of the earth.
