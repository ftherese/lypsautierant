Psalm 57

2 Have mercy on me, God, have mercy,
for in you my soul has taken refuge.
In the shadow of your wings I take refuge,
till the storms of destruction pass by.

3 I call to you, God the Most High,
to God who provides for me.
4 May he send from heaven and save me,
and put to shame those who assail me.
May God send his loving mercy and faithfulness. 

5 My soul lies down among lions,
who would devour the sons of men.
Their teeth are spears and arrows,
their tongue a sharpened sword.
6 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
may your glory shine on earth!

7 They laid down a net for my steps;
my soul was bowed down.
They dug a pit in my path,
but fell in it themselves.

8 My heart is ready, O God;
my heart is ready.
I will sing, I will sing your praise.
9 Awake, my soul! 
Awake, lyre and harp!
I will awake the dawn.

10 I will praise you, Lord, among the peoples,
among the nations sing psalms to you,
11 for your mercy reaches to the heavens,
and your truth to the skies.
12 Be exalted, O God, above the heavens;
may your glory shine on all the earth!
