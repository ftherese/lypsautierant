Psalm 145

1 I will extol you, my God and king,
and bless your name forever and ever.

2 I will bless you day after day,
and praise your name forever and ever.
3 The LORD is great and highly to be praised;
his greatness cannot be measured.

4 Age to age shall proclaim your works,
shall declare your mighty deeds.
5 They will tell of your great glory and splendor,
and recount your wonderful works.

6 They will speak of your awesome deeds,
recount your greatness and might.
7 They will recall your abundant goodness,
and sing of your just deeds with joy.

8 The LORD is kind and full of compassion,
slow to anger, abounding in mercy.
9 How good is the LORD to all,
compassionate to all his creatures.

10 All your works shall thank you, O LORD,
and all your faithful ones bless you.
11 They shall speak of the glory of your reign,
and declare your mighty deeds,

12 To make known your might to the children of men,
and the glorious splendor of your reign.
13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom;
your rule endures for all generations.

The LORD is faithful in all his words,
and holy in all his deeds.
14 The LORD supports all who fall,
and raises up all who are bowed down.

15 The eyes of all look to you,
and you give them their food in due season.
16 You open your hand and satisfy
the desire of every living thing.

17 The LORD is just in all his ways,
and holy in all his deeds.
18 The LORD is close to all who call him,
who call on him in truth.

19 He fulfills the desires of those who fear him;
he hears their cry and he saves them.
20 The LORD keeps watch over all who love him;
the wicked he will utterly destroy.

21 Let my mouth speak the praise of the LORD;
let all flesh bless his holy name
forever, for ages unending.
