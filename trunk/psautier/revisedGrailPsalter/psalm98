Psalm 98

1 O sing a new song to the Lord,
for he has worked wonders.
His right hand and his holy arm
have brought salvation.

2 The Lord has made known his salvation,
has shown his deliverance to the nations.
3 He has remembered his merciful love
and his truth for the house of Israel.

All the ends of the earth have seen
the salvation of our God.
4 Shout to the Lord, all the earth;
break forth into joyous song,
and sing out your praise.

5 Sing psalms to the Lord with the harp,
with the harp and the sound of song.
6 With trumpets and the sound of the horn,
raise a shout before the King, the Lord.

7 Let the sea and all within it thunder;
the world, and those who dwell in it.
8 Let the rivers clap their hands,
and the hills ring out their joy
9 at the presence of the Lord, for he comes,
he comes to judge the earth.

He will judge the world with justice,
and the peoples with fairness.

Now and forever. Amen.
