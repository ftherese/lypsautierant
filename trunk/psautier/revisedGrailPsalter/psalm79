Psalm 79

1 O God, the nations have invaded your heritage;
they have profaned your holy temple.
They have made Jerusalem a heap of ruins.
2 They have handed over the bodies of your servants
as food to feed the birds of heaven,
and the flesh of your faithful to the beasts of the earth.

3 They have poured out their blood like water round Jerusalem;
no one is left to bury the dead.
4 We have become the taunt of our neighbors,
the mockery and scorn of those around us.
5 How long, O Lord? Will you be angry forever?
Will your jealous anger burn like fire?

6 Pour out your rage on the nations,
those that do not know you,
kingdoms that do not call upon your name.
7 For they have devoured Jacob
and laid waste the place where he dwells.

8 Do not remember against us
the guilt of former times.
Let your compassion hasten to meet us;
for we have been brought very low.

9 Help us, O God our savior,
for the sake of the glory of your name.
Free us and forgive us our sins,
because of your name.

10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
Before our eyes make it known among the nations
that you avenge the blood of your servants that was shed!
11 Let the groans of the prisoners come before you,
your strong arm reprieve those condemned to die.

12 Pay back to our neighbors seven times over
the taunts with which they taunted you, O Lord.
13 Then we, your people, the flock of your pasture,
will give you thanks forever and ever.
From age to age we will recount your praise.

Now and forever. Amen.
