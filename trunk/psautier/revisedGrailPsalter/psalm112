Psalm 112

1 Alleluia!

Blessed the man who fears the Lord,
who takes great delight in his commandments.
2 His descendants shall be powerful on earth;
the generation of the upright will be blest.

3 Riches and wealth are in his house;
his justice stands firm forever.
4 A light rises in the darkness for the upright;
he is generous, merciful, and just.

5 It goes well for the man who deals generously and lends,
who conducts his affairs with justice.
6 He will never be moved;
forever shall the just be remembered.

7 He has no fear of evil news;
with a firm heart, he trusts in the Lord.
8 With a steadfast heart he will not fear;
he will see the downfall of his foes.

9 Open-handed, he gives to the poor;
his justice stands firm forever.
His might shall be exalted in glory.

10 The wicked sees and is angry,
grinds his teeth and fades away;
the desire of the wicked leads to doom.

Now and forever. Amen.
