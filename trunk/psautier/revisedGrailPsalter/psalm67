Psalm 67

2 O God, be gracious and bless us
and let your face shed its light upon us.
3 So will your ways be known upon earth
and all nations learn your salvation.

4 Let the peoples praise you, O God;
let all the peoples praise you.

5 Let the nations be glad and shout for joy,
with uprightness you rule the peoples;
you guide the nations on earth.

6 Let the peoples praise you, O God;
let all the peoples praise you.

7 The earth has yielded its fruit
for God, our God, has blessed us.
8 May God still give us his blessing
that all the ends of the earth may revere him.

Now and forever. Amen.
