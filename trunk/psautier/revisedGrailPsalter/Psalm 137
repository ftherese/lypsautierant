Psalm 137

1 By the rivers of Babylon
there we sat and wept,
remembering Sion;
2 on the poplars that grew there
we hung up our harps.

3 For it was there that they asked us,
our captors, for songs,
our oppressors, for joy.
“Sing to us,” they said,
“one of Sion’s songs.”

4 O how could we sing
the song of the LORD
on foreign soil?
5 If I forget you, Jerusalem,
let my right hand wither!

6 O let my tongue
cleave to my palate
if I remember you not,
if I prize not Jerusalem
as the first of my joys!

7 Remember, O LORD,
against the children of Edom
the day of Jerusalem,
when they said, “Tear it down!
Tear it down to its foundations!”

8 O daughter Babylon, destroyer,
blessed whoever repays you
the payment you paid to us!
9 Blessed whoever grasps and shatters
your children on the rock!
