Psalm 3

2 How many are my foes, O Lord!
How many are rising up against me!
3 How many are saying about me,
“There is no help for him in God.”
 
4 But you, Lord, are a shield about me,
my glory, who lift up my head.
5 I cry aloud to the Lord.
From his holy mountain he answers me.

6 I lie down, I sleep and I wake,
for the Lord upholds me.
7 I will not fear even thousands of people
who are ranged on every side against me.

Arise, Lord; save me, my God,
8 you who strike all my foes on the cheek,
you who break the teeth of the wicked!
9 Salvation belongs to the Lord;
may your blessing be on your people!

Now and forever. Amen.
