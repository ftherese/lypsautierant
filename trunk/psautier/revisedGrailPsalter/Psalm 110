Psalm 110

1 The Lord’s revelation to my Lord:
“Sit at my right hand,
until I make your foes your footstool.”

2 The Lord will send from Sion
your scepter of power:
rule in the midst of your foes.

3 With you is princely rule
on the day of your power.
In holy splendor, from the womb before the dawn,
I have begotten you.

4 The Lord has sworn an oath he will not change:
“You are a priest forever,
in the line of Melchizedek.”

5 The Lord, standing at your right,
shatters kings in the day of his wrath.

6 He brings a judgment among the nations,
and heaps the bodies high;
he shatters heads throughout the wide earth.

7 He shall drink from the stream by the wayside,
and therefore he shall lift up his head.
