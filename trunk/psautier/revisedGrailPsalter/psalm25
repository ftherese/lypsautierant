Psalm 25

1 To you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
2 In you, O my God, I have trusted;
let me not be put to shame;
let not my enemies exult over me.
3 Let none who hope in you be put to shame;
but shamed are those who wantonly break faith.

4 O Lord, make me know your ways.
Teach me your paths.
5 Guide me in your truth, and teach me;
for you are the God of my salvation.
I have hoped in you all day long.

6 Remember your compassion, O Lord,
and your merciful love,
for they are from of old.

7 Do not remember the sins of my youth,
nor my transgressions.
In your merciful love remember me,
because of your goodness, O Lord.

8 Good and upright is the Lord;
he shows the way to sinners.
9 He guides the humble in right judgment;
to the humble he teaches his way.

10 All the Lord’s paths are mercy and faithfulness,
for those who keep his covenant and commands.
11 O Lord, for the sake of your name,
forgive my guilt, for it is great.

12 Who is this that fears the Lord?
He will show him the path to choose.
13 His soul shall live in happiness,
and his descendants shall possess the land.
14 The Lord’s secret is for those who fear him;
to them he reveals his covenant.

15 My eyes are always on the Lord,
for he rescues my feet from the snare.
16 Turn to me and have mercy on me,
for I am alone and poor.

17 Relieve the anguish of my heart,
and set me free from my distress.
18 See my lowliness and suffering,
and take away all my sins.

19 See how many are my foes;
with a violent hatred they hate me.
20  Preserve my life and rescue me.
Let me not be put to shame,
for in you I trust.

21 May integrity and virtue protect me,
for I have hoped in you, O Lord.
22 Redeem Israel, O God,
from all its distress.

Now and forever. Amen.
