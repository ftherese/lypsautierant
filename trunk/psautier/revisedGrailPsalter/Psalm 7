Psalm 7

2 O Lord, my Gód, I take réfuge in yóu.
Save and réscue me from áll my pursúers,
3 lest they téar me apárt like a líon,
and drag me óff with nó one to réscue me.

4 If I have dóne this, O Lórd, my Gód,
5 if I have páid back évil for góod,
I who sáved my unjúst oppréssor:
6 then let my fóe pursúe my soul and séize me;
let him trámple my lífe to the gróund,
and láy my hónor in the dúst.

7 O Lórd, rise úp in your ánger;
be exálted against the fúry of my fóes.
Awáke, my Gód, to enáct
the jústice you órdered.
8 Let the cómpany of péoples gather róund you,
as you táke your seat abóve them on hígh.

9 The Lórd is júdge of the péoples.
Give júdgment for mé, O Lórd,
for I am júst and blámeless of héart.


10 Put an énd to the évil of the wícked!
Make the júst man stand fírm;
it is yóu who test mínd and héart,
O Gód of jústice!

11 Gód is a shíeld befóre me,
who sáves the úpright of héart.
12 God is a júdge, just and pówerful and pátient,
not éxercising ánger every dáy.

13 Against sómeone who does nót repént,
Gód will shárpen his swórd;
he bénds his bów and makes réady.
14 For such a óne he prepáres deadly wéapons;
he bárbs his árrows with fíre.

15 Here is óne who concéives iníquity;
pregnant with málice, he gives bírth to líes.
16 He digs a pít and bóres it déep;
and in the tráp he has máde he fálls.
17 His málice recóils on his héad;
on his own skúll his víolence fálls.

18 I thánk the Lórd for his jústice,
singing to the náme of the Lórd, the Most Hígh.
