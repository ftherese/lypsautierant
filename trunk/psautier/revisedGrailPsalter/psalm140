Psalm 119:161-168

161 Though princes oppress me without cause,
my heart reveres your word.
162 I rejoice at your promise,
like one who finds a great treasure.

163 Falsehood I hate and detest,
but I love your law.
164 Seven times a day I praise you
for your just decrees.

165 The lovers of your law have great peace;
no stumbling block for them.
166 I await your salvation, O Lord;
I fulfill your commands.

167 My soul obeys your decrees,
and loves them dearly.
168 I obey your precepts and decrees;
all my ways are before you.v

Now and forever. Amen.
