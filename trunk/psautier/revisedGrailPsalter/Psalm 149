Psalm 149

1 Alleluia!

Sing a new song to the LORD,
his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
2 Let Israel rejoice in its Maker;
let Sionâ€™s children exult in their king.
3 Let them praise his name with dancing,
and make music with timbrel and harp.

4 For the LORD takes delight in his people;
he crowns the poor with salvation.
5 Let the faithful exult in glory,
and rejoice as they take their rest.
6 Let the praise of God be in their mouths
and a two-edged sword in their hand,

7 To deal out vengeance to the nations
and punishment upon the peoples;
8 to bind their kings in chains
and their nobles in fetters of iron;
9 to carry out the judgment decreed.
This is an honor for all his faithful.

Alleluia!
