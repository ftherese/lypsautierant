Psalm 17

1 O Lord, hear a cause that is just;
pay heed to my cry.
Turn your ear to my prayer:
no deceit is on my lips.
2 From you may my justice come forth.
Your eyes discern what is upright.

3 Search my heart and visit me by night.
Test me by fire, and you will find no wrong in me.

4 My mouth does not transgress as others do;
on account of the words of your lips,
I closely watched the paths of the violent.

5 I kept my steps firmly in your paths.
My feet have never faltered.

6 To you I call; for you will surely heed me, O God.
Turn your ear to me; hear my words.
7 Display your merciful love.
By your right hand you deliver from their foes
those who put their trust in you.

8 Guard me as the apple of your eye.
Hide me in the shadow of your wings
9 from the violent attack of the wicked.

My foes encircle me with deadly intent.
10  Their hearts tight shut, their mouths speak proudly.
11 They advance against me, and now they surround me.
Their eyes watch to strike me to the ground.
12 They are like a lion ready to claw,
like some young lion crouched in hiding.

13 Arise, O Lord, confront them, strike them down!
Let your sword deliver my soul from the wicked!
14 Let your hand, O Lord, deliver me from those
whose portion in this present life is fleeting.

May you give them their fill of your treasures;
may their offspring rejoice in plenty,
and leave their wealth to their children.
15 As for me, in justice I shall behold your face;
when I awake I shall be filled with the vision of your presence.

Now and forever. Amen.
