Psalm 33

1 Ring out your joy to the Lord, O you just;
for praise is fitting for the upright.
2 Give thanks to the Lord upon the harp;
with a ten-stringed lute sing him songs.
3 O sing him a song that is new;
play skillfully, with shouts of joy.

4 For the word of the Lord is faithful,
and all his works to be trusted.
5 The Lord loves justice and right,
and his merciful love fills the earth.

6 By the word of the Lord the heavens were made,
by the breath of his mouth all their host.
7 As in a flask, he collects the waves of the ocean;
he stores up the depths of the sea.

8 Let all the earth fear the Lord,
all who live in the world revere him.
9 He spoke, and it came to be.
He commanded; it stood in place.

10 The Lord frustrates the designs of the nations;
he defeats the plans of the peoples.
11 The designs of the Lord stand forever,
the plans of his heart from age to age.

12 Blessed the nation whose God is the Lord,
the people he has chosen as his heritage.
13 From the heavens the Lord looks forth;
he sees all the children of men.

14 From the place where he dwells he gazes
on all the dwellers on the earth,
15 he who shapes the hearts of them all,
and considers all their deeds.

16 A king is not saved by his great army,
nor a warrior preserved by his great strength.
17 A vain hope for safety is the horse;
despite its power it cannot save.

18 Yes, the Lordâ€™s eyes are on those who fear him,
who hope in his merciful love,
19 to rescue their souls from death,
to keep them alive in famine.

20  Our soul is waiting for the Lord.
He is our help and our shield.
21 In him do our hearts find joy.
We trust in his holy name.
22 May your merciful love be upon us,
as we hope in you, O Lord.
