Psalm 126

1 When the LORD brought back the exiles of Sion,
we thought we were dreaming.
2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter;
on our tongues, songs of joy.

Then the nations themselves said, “What great deeds
the LORD worked for them!”
3 What great deeds the LORD worked for us!
Indeed, we were glad.

4 Bring back our exiles, O LORD,
as streams in the south.
5 Those who are sowing in tears
will sing when they reap.

6 They go out, they go out, full of tears,
bearing seed for the sowing;
they come back, they come back with a song,
bearing their sheaves.
