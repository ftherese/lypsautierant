Psalm 119:1-8

1 Blessed are those whose way is blameless,
who walk in the law of the Lord!
2 Blessed are those who keep his decrees!
With all their hearts they seek him.

3 They never do anything evil,
but walk in his ways.
4 You have laid down your precepts
to be carefully kept.

5 May my ways be firm
in keeping your statutes.
6 Then I shall not be put to shame
as I observe all your commands.

7 I will thank you with an upright heart,
as I learn your just judgments.
8 I will keep your statutes;
do not ever forsake me.

Now and forever. Amen.
