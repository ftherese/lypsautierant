Psalm 85

2 O Lord, you have favored your land,
and brought back the captives of Jacob.
3 You forgave the guilt of your people,
and covered all their sins.
4 You averted all your rage;
you turned back the heat of your anger.

5 Bring us back, O God, our savior!
Put an end to your grievance against us.
6 Will you be angry with us forever?
Will your anger last from age to age?

7 Will you not restore again our life,
that your people may rejoice in you?
8 Let us see, O Lord, your mercy,
and grant us your salvation.

9 I will hear what the Lord God speaks;
he speaks of peace for his people and his faithful,
and those who turn their hearts to him.
10 His salvation is near for those who fear him,
and his glory will dwell in our land.

11 Merciful love and faithfulness have met;
justice and peace have kissed.
12 Faithfulness shall spring from the earth,
and justice look down from heaven.

13 Also the Lord will bestow his bounty,
and our earth shall yield its increase.
14 Justice will march before him,
and guide his steps on the way.
