Psalm 125

1 Those who put their trust in the LORD
are like Mount Sion, that cannot be shaken,
that stands forever.
2 Jerusalem! The mountains surround her;
so the LORD surrounds his people,
both now and forever.

3 For the scepter of the wicked shall not rest
over the land allotted to the just,
for fear that the hands of the just
should turn to evil.

4 Do good, LORD, to those who are good,
to the upright of heart;
5 but those who turn to crooked waysâ€”
the LORD will drive away with the wicked!
On Israel, peace!
