Psalm 49

2 Hear this, all you peoples,
give ear, all who dwell in the world,
3 people both high and low,
rich and poor alike!

4 My mouth will utter wisdom.
The reflections of my heart offer insight.
5 I will incline my ear to a mystery;
with the harp I will set forth my problem.

6 Why should I fear in evil days
the malice of the foes who surround me,
7 those who trust in their wealth,
and boast of the vastness of their riches?

8 No man can ransom a brother,
nor pay a price to God for his life.
9 How high is the price of his soul!
The ransom can never be enough!
10 No one can buy life unending,
nor avoid coming to the grave.

11 Anyone sees that the wise will die;
the foolish will perish with the senseless,
and leave their wealth to others.

12 Their graves are their homes forever,
their dwelling place from age to age,
though lands were called by their names.

13 In his riches, man does not endure;
he is like the beasts that are destroyed.

14 This is the way of the foolish,
the outcome of those pleased with their lot:
15 like sheep they are driven to the grave,
where death shall become their shepherd,
and the upright shall have dominion.

Their outward show wastes away with the morning,
and the grave becomes their home.
16 But God will ransom my soul from the grasp of hell;
for he indeed will receive me.

17 Then do not fear when a man grows rich,
when the glory of his house increases.
18 He takes nothing with him when he dies;
his glory does not follow him below.

19 Though he flattered himself while he lived,
“People will praise me for all my success,”
20 yet he will go to join his forebears,
and will never see the light anymore.

21 In his riches, man cannot discern;
he is like the beasts that are destroyed.

Now and forever. Amen.
