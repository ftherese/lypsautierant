Psalm 113

1 Alleluia!

Praise, O servants of the Lord,
praise the name of the Lord!
2 May the name of the Lord be blest
both now and forevermore!
3 From the rising of the sun to its setting,
praised be the name of the Lord!

4 High above all nations is the Lord,
above the heavens his glory.
5 Who is like the Lord, our God,
who dwells on high,
6 who lowers himself to look down
upon heaven and earth?

7 From the dust he lifts up the lowly,
from the ash heap he raises the poor,
8 to set them in the company of princes,
yes, with the princes of his people.
9 To the childless wife he gives a home
as a joyful mother of children.
