Psalm 6

2 O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger;
reprove me not in your rage.
3 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I languish.
Lord, heal me; my bones are shaking,
4 and my soul is greatly shaken.

But you, O Lord, how long?
5 Return, Lord, rescue my soul.
Save me in your merciful love.
6 For in death there is no remembrance of you;
from the grave, who can give you praise?

7 I am exhausted with my groaning;
every night I drench my bed with tears,
I bedew my couch with weeping.
8 My eyes waste away with grief;
I have grown old surrounded by all my foes.

9 Leave me, all who do evil,
for the Lord heeds the sound of my weeping.
10 The Lord has heard my plea;
the Lord will receive my prayer.
11 All my foes will be shamed and greatly shaken,
suddenly put to shame.

Now and forever. Amen.
