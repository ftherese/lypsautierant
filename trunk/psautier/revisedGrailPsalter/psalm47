Psalm 47

2 All peoples, clap your hands.
Cry to God with shouts of joy!
3 For the Lord, the Most High, is awesome,
the great king over all the earth.

4 He humbles peoples under us
and nations under our feet.
5 Our heritage he chose for us,
the pride of Jacob whom he loves.

6 God goes up with shouts of joy.
The Lord goes up with trumpet blast.
7 Sing praise for God; sing praise!
Sing praise to our king; sing praise!

8 God is king of all the earth.
Sing praise with all your skill.
9 God reigns over the nations. 
God sits upon his holy throne.

10 The princes of the peoples are assembled
with the people of the God of Abraham.
The rulers of the earth belong to God,
who is greatly exalted.

Now and forever. Amen.
