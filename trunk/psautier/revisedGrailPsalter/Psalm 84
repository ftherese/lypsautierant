Psalm 84

2 How lovely is your dwelling place,
O Lord of hosts.
3 My soul is longing and yearning
for the courts of the Lord.
My heart and my flesh cry out
to the living God.

4 Even the sparrow finds a home,
and the swallow a nest for herself
in which she sets her young, at your altars,
O Lord of hosts, my king and my God.

5 Blessed are they who dwell in your house,
forever singing your praise.
6 Blessed the people whose strength is in you,
whose heart is set on pilgrim ways.

7 As they go through the Baca Valley,
they make it a place of springs;
the autumn rain covers it with pools.
8 They walk with ever-growing strength;
the God of gods will appear in Sion.

9 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer;
give ear, O God of Jacob.
10 Turn your eyes, O God, our shield;
look on the face of your anointed.

11 One day within your courts
is better than a thousand elsewhere.
The threshold of the house of God
I prefer to the dwellings of the wicked.

12 For the Lord God is a sun, a shield;
the Lord will give us his favor and glory.
he will not withhold any good
to those who walk without blame.
13 O Lord of hosts, how blessed
is the man who trusts in you!
