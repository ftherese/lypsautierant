Psalm 115

1 Not to us, O Lord, not to us,
but to your name give the glory,
for your merciful love and fidelity.
2 Why should the nations say:
 “Where is their God?”

3 But our God is in the heavens;
he does whatever he wills.
4 Their idols are silver and gold,
the work of human hands.

5 They have mouths but they cannot speak;
they have eyes but they cannot see.
6 They have ears but they cannot hear;
they have nostrils but they cannot smell.

7 They have hands but they cannot feel;
they have feet but they cannot walk.
They make no sound from their throats.
8 Their makers will come to be like them,
as will all who trust in them.

9 House of Israel, trust in the Lord;
he is their help and their shield.
10 House of Aaron, trust in the Lord;
he is their help and their shield.
11 Those who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord;
he is their help and their shield.

12 The Lord remembers us, and he will bless us;
he will bless the house of Israel.
He will bless the house of Aaron.

13 He will bless those who fear the Lord,
the little no less than the great.
14 To you may the Lord grant increase,
to you and all your children.

15 May you be blest by the Lord,
the maker of heaven and earth.
16 The heavens, the heavens belong to the Lord,
but to the children of men, he has given the earth.

17 The dead shall not praise the Lord,
nor those who go down into the silence.
18 But we who live bless the Lord
both now and forevermore.

Alleluia!

Now and forever. Amen.
