Psalm 65

2 Praise is due to you
in Sion, O God.
To you we pay our vows in Jerusalem,
3 you who hear our prayer.

To you all flesh will come.
4 Our evil deeds are too heavy for us,
but our transgressions you wipe away.

5 Blessed is he whom you choose and call
to dwell in your courts.
We are filled with the good things of your house,
of your holy temple.

6 With wondrous deliverance you answer us,
O God our savior.
You are the hope of all the earth,
and of far distant isles.

7 You establish the mountains with your strength;
you are girded with power.
8 You still the roaring of the seas,
the roaring of their waves,
and the tumult of the peoples.

9 Distant peoples stand in awe
at your wondrous deeds.
The lands of sunrise and sunset
you fill with your joy.

10 You visit the earth, give it water;
you fill it with riches.
Godâ€™s ever-flowing river brims over
to prepare the grain.

And thus you provide for the earth:
11 you drench its furrows;
you level it, soften it with showers;
you bless its growth.

12 You crown the year with your bounty.
Abundance flows in your pathways;
13 in pastures of the desert it flows.

The hills are girded with joy,
14 the meadows clothed with flocks.
The valleys are decked with wheat.
They shout for joy; yes, they sing!

Now and forever. Amen.
