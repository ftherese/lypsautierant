Psalm 15

1 Lord, who may abide in your tent,
and dwell on your holy mountain?
2 Whoever walks without fault;
who does what is just,
and speaks the truth from his heart.

3 Whoever does not slander with his tongue,
who does no wrong to a neighbor,
who casts no slur on a friend,
4 who looks with scorn on the wicked,
but honors those who fear the Lord.

Who keeps an oath, whatever the cost,
5 who lends no money at interest,
and accepts no bribes against the innocent.
Such a one shall never be shaken.

Now and forever. Amen.
