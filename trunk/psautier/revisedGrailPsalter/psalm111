Psalm 111

1 Alleluia!

I will praise the Lord with all my heart,
in the meeting of the just and the assembly.
2 Great are the works of the Lord,
to be pondered by all who delight in them.

3 Majestic and glorious his work;
his justice stands firm forever.
4 He has given us a memorial of his wonders.
The Lord is gracious and merciful.

5 He gives food to those who fear him;
keeps his covenant ever in mind.
6 His mighty works he has shown to his people
by giving them the heritage of nations.

7 His handiwork is justice and truth;
his precepts are all of them sure,
8 standing firm forever and ever,
wrought in uprightness and truth.

9 He has sent redemption to his people,
and established his covenant forever.
Holy his name, to be feared.

10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom;
understanding marks all who attain it.
His praise endures forever!

Now and forever. Amen.
