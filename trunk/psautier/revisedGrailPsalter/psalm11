Psalm 11

1 In the Lord I have taken refuge.
How can you say to my soul,
“Fly like a bird to the mountain!

2 Look, the wicked are bending their bow!
They are fixing their arrow on the string,
to shoot the upright of heart in the dark.
3 Foundations once destroyed,
what can the just man do?”

4 The Lord is in his holy temple;
the throne of the Lord is in heaven.
His eyes behold the world;
his gaze probes the children of men.

5 The Lord inspects the just and the wicked;
the lover of violence he hates.
6 He sends fire and brimstone on the wicked,
a scorching wind to fill their cup.
7 For the Lord is just and loves deeds of justice;
the upright shall behold his face.

Now and forever. Amen.
