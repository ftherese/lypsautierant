Psalm 72

1 O God, give your judgment to the king,
to a kingâ€™s son your justice,
2 that he may judge your people in justice,
and your poor in right judgment.

3 May the mountains bring forth peace for the people,
and the hills justice.
4 May he defend the poor of the people,
and save the children of the needy,
and crush the oppressor.

5 He shall endure like the sun and the moon
through all generations.
6 He shall descend like rain on the meadow,
like showers that water the earth.
7 In his days shall justice flourish,
and great peace till the moon is no more.

8 He shall rule from sea to sea,
from the River to the bounds of the earth.
9 Let the desert dwellers fall before him,
and his enemies lick the dust.

10 The kings of Tarshish and the islands
shall pay him tribute.
The kings of Sheba and Seba
shall bring him gifts.
11 Before him all kings shall fall prostrate,
all nations shall serve him.

12 For he shall save the needy when they cry,
the poor, and those who are helpless.
13 He will have pity on the weak and the needy,
and save the lives of the needy.
14 From oppression and violence he redeems their souls;
to him their blood is dear.

15 Long may he live!
May the gold of Sheba be given him.
They shall pray for him without ceasing,
and bless him all the day.

16 May grain be abundant in the land,
waving to the peaks of the mountains.
May its fruit rustle like Lebanon;
may the people flourish in the cities
like grass on the earth.

17 May his name endure forever,
his name continue like the sun.
Every tribe shall be blest in him,
all nations shall call him blessed.

[18]Blest be the Lord, God of Israel,
who alone works wonders,
[19]ever blest his glorious name.
Let his glory fill the earth.
Amen! Amen!

Now and forever. Amen.
