Psalm 119:49-56

49 Remember your word to your servant,
by which you made me hope.
50  This is my comfort in sorrow:
that your promise gives me life.

51 Though the proud may utterly deride me,
I do not turn from your law.
52 When I remember your judgments of old,
these, O LORD, console me.

53 I am seized with indignation at the wicked
who forsake your law.
54 Your statutes have become my song
wherever I dwell.

55 I remember your name in the nighttime,
and I keep your law.
56 This has been my lot,
for I have kept your precepts.
