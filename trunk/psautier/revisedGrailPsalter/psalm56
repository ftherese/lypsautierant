Psalm 56

2 Have mercy on me, O God,
for people assail me;
they fight me all day long and oppress me.
3 My foes assail me all day long:
many fight proudly against me.

4 On the day when I shall fear,
I will trust in you,
5 in God, whose word I praise.
In God I trust; I shall not fear.
What can mere flesh do to me?

6 All day long they distort my words;
their every thought against me is evil.
7 They band together in ambush;
they watch my very footsteps,
as they wait to take my life.

8 Repay them, O God, for their crimes;
in your anger, bring down the peoples.
9 You have kept an account of my wanderings;
you have placed my tears in your flask;
are they not recorded in your book?
10 Then my foes will turn back
on the day when I call to you.

This I know, that God is on my side.
11 In God, whose word I praise,
in the Lord whose word I praise,
12 in God I trust; I shall not fear.
What can man do to me?

13 I am bound by the vows I have made you.
O God, I will offer you praise,
14 for you have rescued my soul from death;
you kept my feet from stumbling,
that I may walk in the presence of God,
in the light of the living.

Now and forever. Amen.
