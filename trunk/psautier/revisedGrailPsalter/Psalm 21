Psalm 21

2 In your stréngth, O Lórd, the kíng rejóices;
how gréatly your salvátion mákes him glád!
3 You have gránted hím his héart’s desíre;
you have nót withhéld the práyer of his líps.

4 You cáme to méet him with bléssings of prospérity;
you have sét on his héad a crówn of pure góld.
5 He ásked you for lífe and thís you have gíven:
dáys that will lást from áge to áge.

6 By your sáving help gréat is his glóry;
you have bestówed upon him májesty and spléndor;
7 you have gránted him bléssings foréver,
made him rejóice with the jóy of your présence.

8 The kíng has pláced his trúst in the Lórd.
Through the mércy of the Móst High, hé is unsháken.

9 Your hánd will find óut all your fóes,
your right hánd will find óut those that háte you.
10 You will búrn them like a blázing fúrnace
on the dáy when yóu appéar,
and the Lórd will consúme them in his ánger:
fíre will swállow them úp.

11 You will wípe out their descéndants from the éarth,
and their óffspring from the húman ráce.
12 Thóugh they planned évil agáinst you,
though they plótted, they shall nót preváil.

13 For yóu will fórce them to retréat;
at thém you will áim with your bów.
14 O Lórd, aríse in your stréngth;
we shall síng and práise your pówer.
