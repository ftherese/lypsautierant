Psalm 123

1 To you have I lifted up my eyes,
you who dwell in the heavens.

2 Behold, like the eyes of slaves
on the hand of their LORDs,
like the eyes of a servant
on the hand of her mistress,
so our eyes are on the LORD our God,
till he show us his mercy.

3 Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy.
We are filled with contempt.
4 Indeed, all too full is our soul
with the scorn of the arrogant,
the disdain of the proud.
