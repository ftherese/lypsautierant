Psalm 17

1 O Lórd, hear a cáuse that is júst;
pay héed to my crý.
Túrn your éar to my práyer:
no decéit is on my líps.
2 From yóu may my jústice come fórth.
Your eyes discérn what is úpright.

3 Search my héart and vísit me by níght.
Test me by fíre, and you will fínd no wrong in mé.

4 My móuth does not transgréss as others dó;
on accóunt of the wórds of your líps,
I closely wátched the páths of the víolent.

5 I képt my steps fírmly in your páths.
My féet have néver fáltered.

6 To you I cáll; for you will súrely héed me, O Gód.
Túrn your éar to me; héar my wórds.
7 Displáy your mérciful lóve.
By your right hánd you delíver from their fóes
those who pút their trúst in yóu.

8 Gúard me as the ápple of your éye.
Híde me in the shádow of your wíngs
9 from the víolent attáck of the wícked.

My fóes encírcle me with déadly intént.
10 Their héarts tight shút, their móuths speak próudly.
11 They advánce agáinst me, and nów they surróund me.
Their éyes wátch to stríke me to the gróund.
12 Théy are like a líon réady to cláw,
líke some young líon cróuched in híding.

13 Arise, O Lórd, confrónt them, stríke them dówn!
Let your swórd delíver my sóul from the wícked!
14 Let your hánd, O Lórd, delíver me from thóse
whose pórtion in this présent lífe is fléeting.

May you gíve them their fíll of your tréasures;
may their óffspring rejóice in plénty,
and léave their wéalth to their chíldren.
15 As for mé, in jústice I shall behóld your fáce;
when I awáke I shall be fílled with the vísion of your présence.
