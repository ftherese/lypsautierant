Psalm 119:73-80

73 It was your hands that made me and shaped me;
grant me insight to learn your commands.
74 Those who revere you see me and rejoice,
for I trust in your word.

75 O Lord, I know that your decrees are right;
though I am humbled, you are just.
76 Let your merciful love console me
by your promise to your servant.

77 Show me compassion, that I may live,
for your law is my delight.
78 Let the arrogant be shamed who deflect me with lies;
as for me, I will ponder your precepts.

79 Let those who fear you turn to me,
that they may know your decrees.
80  Let my heart be blameless in your statutes,
that I may not be put to shame.

Now and forever. Amen.
