Psalm 10

1 O Lord, why do you stand afar off,
and hide yourself in times of distress?
2 The poor are devoured by the pride of the wicked;
they are caught in the schemes that others have made.

3 For the wicked boasts of his soul’s desires;
the covetous blasphemes and spurns the Lord.
4 The wicked says in his pride, “God will not punish.
There is no God.” Such are his thoughts.

5 His path is ever untroubled;
your judgments are on high, far removed.
All those who oppose him, he derides.
6 In his heart he thinks, “Never shall I falter;
never shall misfortune be my lot.”

7 His mouth is full of cursing, guile, oppression;
under his tongue are deceit and evil.
8 He sits in ambush in the villages;
in hidden places, he murders the innocent.

The eyes of the wicked keep watch for the helpless.
9 He lurks in hiding like a lion in his lair;
he lurks in hiding to seize the poor;
he seizes the poor one and drags him away.

10 He crouches, preparing to spring,
and the helpless fall prey to his strength.
11 He says in his heart, “God forgets,
he hides his face, never will he see.”

12 Arise, O Lord; lift up your hand, O God!
Do not forget the poor!
13 Why should the wicked spurn God,
saying in his heart, “You will not call to account”?

14 But you have seen the trouble and sorrow.
You note it; you take it in your hands.
The helpless one relies on you,
for you are the helper of the orphan.

15 Break the arm of the wicked and the sinner!
Pursue their wickedness till nothing remains!
16 The Lord is king forever and ever.
The nations shall perish from his land.

17 O Lord, you have heard the desire of the poor.
You strengthen their hearts; you turn your ear
18 to give right judgment for the orphan and oppressed,
so that no one on earth may strike terror again.

Now and forever. Amen.
