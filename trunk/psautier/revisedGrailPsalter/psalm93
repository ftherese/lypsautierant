Psalm 93

1 The Lord is king, with majesty enrobed.
The Lord has robed himself with might;
he has girded himself with power.

The world you made firm, not to be moved;
2 your throne has stood firm from of old.
From all eternity, O Lord, you are.

3 The floods have lifted up, O Lord,
the floods have lifted up their voice;
the floods have lifted up their thunder.

4 Greater than the roar of mighty waters,
more glorious than the surgings of the sea,
the Lord is glorious on high.

5 Truly your decrees are to be trusted.
Holiness is fitting to your house,
O Lord, until the end of time.

Now and forever. Amen.
