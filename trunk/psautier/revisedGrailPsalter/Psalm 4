Psalm 4

2 I called, the God of justice gave me answer;
from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me!

3 Children of man, how long will my glory be dishonored,
will you love what is futile and seek what is false?

4 Know that the Lord works wonders for his faithful one;
the Lord will hear me whenever I call him.

5 Tremble, do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still.
6 Offer right sacrifice, and trust in the Lord.

7 “What can bring us happiness?” many say.
Lift up the light of your face on us, O Lord.

8 You have put into my heart a greater joy
than abundance of grain and new wine can provide.

9 In peace I will lie down and fall asleep,
for you alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.
