Psalm 75

2 We give praise to you, O God;
we give praise, for your name is near.
We recount your wonderful deeds.

3 “When I establish the appointed time,
then I myself will judge with fairness.
4 Though the earth and all who dwell in it may rock,
it is I who set firm its pillars.

5 To the boastful I say, ‘Do not boast’;
to the wicked, ‘Do not flaunt your strength,
6 do not flaunt your strength on high.
Do not speak with insolent pride.’”

7 For neither from the east nor from the west,
nor from the desert comes honor,
8 for God himself is the judge.
One he humbles, another he exalts.

9 For the Lord holds a cup in his hand,
full of wine, foaming and spiced.
He pours it; they drain it to the dregs;
all the wicked on the earth must drain it.

10 As for me, I will rejoice forever,
and sing psalms to the God of Jacob.
11 I shall break the strength of the wicked,
while the strength of the just will be exalted.

Now and forever. Amen.
