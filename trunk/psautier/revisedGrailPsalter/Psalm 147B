Psalm 147B

12 O Jerusalem, glorify the LORD!
O Sion, praise your God!
13 He has strengthened the bars of your gates;
he has blessed your children within you.
14 He established peace on your borders;
he gives you your fill of finest wheat.

15 He sends out his word to the earth,
and swiftly runs his command.
16 He showers down snow like wool;
he scatters hoarfrost like ashes.

17 He hurls down hailstones like crumbs;
before such cold, who can stand?
18 He sends forth his word and it melts them;
at the blowing of his breath the waters flow.

19 He reveals his word to Jacob;
to Israel, his decrees and judgments.
20 He has not dealt thus with other nations;
he has not taught them his judgments.

Alleluia!
