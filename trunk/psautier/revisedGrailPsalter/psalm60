Psalm 60

3 O God, you have rejected us, and broken us.
You have been angry; come back to us.

4 You have made the earth quake, torn it open.
Repair what is shattered, for it sways.
5 You have inflicted hardships on your people,
made us drink a wine that dazed us.

6 For those who fear you, you gave the signal
to flee from the face of the bow.
7 With your right hand, grant salvation, and give answer,
that those whom you love may be free.

8 From his holy place God has spoken:
“I will exult, and divide the land of Shechem;
I will measure out the valley of Succoth.

9 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh;
Ephraim I take for my helmet,
Judah is my scepter.

10 Moab is my washbowl;
on Edom I will cast my shoe.
Over Philistia I will shout in triumph.”

11 But who will lead me to the fortified city?
Who will bring me to Edom?
12 Have you, O God, rejected us?
Will you march with our armies no longer?

13 Give us help against the foe,
for the help of man is vain.
14 With God, we shall do bravely,
and he will trample down our foes.

Now and forever. Amen.
