Psalm 14

1 The fóol has sáid in his héart,
“There ís no Gód.”
Their déeds are corrúpt, depráved;
no one dóes any góod.

2 From héaven the Lórd looks dówn
on the húman ráce,
to sée if ány are wíse,
if ány seek Gód.

3 Áll have góne astráy,
depráved, every óne;
there is nó one who dóes any góod;
nó, not even óne.

4 Do nóne of the évildoers únderstand?
They eat úp my péople as if éating bréad;
they néver call óut to the Lórd.

5 Thére they shall trémble with féar,
for Gód is with the generátion of the júst.
6 You may móck the pláns of one that is póor,
but his réfuge is the Lórd.

7 O that Ísrael’s salvátion might come from Síon.
When the Lórd delívers his péople from bóndage,
then Jácob will be glád and Ísrael rejóice.
