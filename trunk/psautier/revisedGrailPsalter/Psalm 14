Psalm 14

1 The fool has said in his heart,
“There is no God.”
Their deeds are corrupt, depraved;
no one does any good.

2 From heaven the Lord looks down
on the human race,
to see if any are wise,
if any seek God.

3 All have gone astray,
depraved, every one;
there is no one who does any good;
no, not even one.

4 Do none of the evildoers understand?
They eat up my people as if eating bread;
they never call out to the Lord.

5 There they shall tremble with fear,
for God is with the generation of the just.
6 You may mock the plans of one that is poor,
but his refuge is the Lord.

7 O that Israel’s salvation might come from Sion.
When the Lord delivers his people from bondage,
then Jacob will be glad and Israel rejoice.
