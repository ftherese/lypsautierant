Psalm 42

2 Like the deer that yearns
for running streams,
so my soul is yearning
for you, my God.

3 My soul is thirsting for God,
the living God;
when can I enter and appear
before the face of God?

4 My tears have become my bread,
by day, by night,
as they say to me all the day long,
“Where is your God?”

5 These things will I remember
as I pour out my soul:
For I would go to the place 
of your wondrous tent,
all the way to the house of God,
amid cries of gladness and thanksgiving,
the throng keeping joyful festival.

6 Why are you cast down, my soul;
why groan within me?
Hope in God; I will praise him yet again,
my saving presence and my God.

7 My soul is cast down within me,
therefore I remember you 
from the land of Jordan and Mount Hermon,
from the Hill of Mizar.

8 Deep is calling on deep,
in the roar of your torrents;
your billows and all your waves
swept over me.

9 By day the Lord decrees
his merciful love;
by night his song is with me,
prayer to the God of my life.

10 I will say to God, my rock,
“Why have you forgotten me?
Why do I go mourning
oppressed by the foe?”

11 With a deadly wound in my bones,
my enemies revile me,
saying to me all the day long,
“Where is your God?”

12 Why are you cast down, my soul;
why groan within me?
Hope in God; I will praise him yet again,
my saving presence and my God.
