Psalm 96

1 O sing a new song to the Lord;
sing to the Lord, all the earth.
2 O sing to the Lord; bless his name.
Proclaim his salvation day by day.
3 Tell among the nations his glory,
and his wonders among all the peoples.

4 For the Lord is great and highly to be praised,
to be feared above all gods.
5 For the gods of the nations are naught.
It was the Lord who made the heavens.
6 In his presence are majesty and splendor,
strength and honor in his holy place.

7 Give the Lord, you families of peoples,
give the Lord glory and power;
8 give the Lord the glory of his name.

Bring an offering and enter his courts;
9 worship the Lord in holy splendor.
O tremble before him, all the earth.

10 Say to the nations, “The Lord is king.”
The world he made firm in its place;
he will judge the peoples in fairness.

11 Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad;
let the sea and all within it thunder praise.
12 Let the land and all it bears rejoice.

Then will all the trees of the wood shout for joy
13 at the presence of the Lord, for he comes,
he comes to judge the earth.
He will judge the world with justice;
he will govern the peoples with his truth.

Now and forever. Amen.
