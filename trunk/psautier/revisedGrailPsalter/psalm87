Psalm 87

1 Founded by him on the holy mountain,
2 the Lord loves the gates of Sion,
more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
3 Of you are told glorious things,
you, O city of God!

4 “Rahab and Babylon I will count
among those who know me;
of Tyre, Philistia, Ethiopia, it is told,
‘There was this one born.’
5 But of Sion it shall be said,
‘Each one was born in her.’”

He, the Most High, established it.
6 In his register of peoples the Lord writes,
“Here was this one born.”
7 The singers cry out in chorus,
“In you, all find their home.”

Now and forever. Amen.
