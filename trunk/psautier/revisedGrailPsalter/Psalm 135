Psalm 135

1 Praise the name of the LORD;
praise him, servants of the LORD,
2 who stand in the house of the LORD,
in the courts of the house of our God.

3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good.
Sing a psalm to his name, for this is our delight.
4 For the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself,
and Israel as his treasured possession.

5 For I know that the LORD is great,
that our LORD is high above all gods.
6 The LORD does whatever he wills,
in heaven, and on earth,
in the seas, and in all the depths.

7 He summons clouds from the ends of the earth,
makes lightning produce the rain;
from his treasuries he sends forth the wind.

8 The firstborn of the Egyptians he smote,
of man and beast alike.
9 He sent signs and wonders in your midst, O Egypt,
against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10 Nations in great numbers he struck,
and kings in their might he slew:

11 Sihon, king of the Amorites,
Og, the king of Bashan,
and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
12 Their land he gave as a heritage,
a heritage to Israel, his people.

13 LORD, your name stands forever,
your renown, LORD, from age to age.
14 For the LORD does justice for his people
and takes pity on his servants.

15 Pagan idols are silver and gold,
the work of human hands.
16 They have mouths but they do not speak;
they have eyes but they do not see.

17 They have ears but they do not hear;
there is never a breath on their lips.
18 Their makers will come to be like them,
and so will all who trust in them!

19 House of Israel, bless the LORD!
House of Aaron, bless the LORD!
20 House of Levi, bless the LORD!
You who fear the LORD, bless the LORD!
21 From Sion may the LORD be blest,
he who dwells in Jerusalem!

Alleluia!
