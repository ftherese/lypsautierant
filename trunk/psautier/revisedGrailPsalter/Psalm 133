Psalm 133

1 How good and how pleasant it is,
when brothers live in unity!

2 It is like precious oil upon the head,
running down upon the beard,
running down upon Aaronâ€™s beard,
upon the collar of his robes;

3 Like the dew of Hermon, which runs down
on the mountains of Sion.
For there the LORD bestows his blessing:
life forever.
