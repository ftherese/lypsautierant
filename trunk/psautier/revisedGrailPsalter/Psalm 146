Psalm 146

1 Alleluia!

My soul, give praise to the LORD;
2 I will praise the LORD all my life,
sing praise to my God while I live.

3 Put no trust in princes,
in mortal man who cannot save.
4 Take their breath, they return to the earth,
and their plans that day come to nothing.

5 Blessed is he who is helped by Jacobâ€™s God,
whose hope is in the LORD his God,
6 who made the heavens and the earth,
the seas and all they contain,
who preserves fidelity forever,
7 who does justice to those who are oppressed.

It is he who gives bread to the hungry,
the LORD who sets prisoners free,
8 the LORD who opens the eyes of the blind,
the LORD who raises up those who are bowed down.

It is the LORD who loves the just,
9 the LORD who protects the stranger
and upholds the orphan and the widow,
but thwarts the path of the wicked.
10 The LORD will reign forever,
the God of Sion from age to age.

Alleluia!
