Psalm 122

1 I rejoiced when they said to me,
“Let us go to the house of the Lord.”
2 And now our feet are standing
within your gates, O Jerusalem.

3 Jerusalem is built as a city
bonded as one together.
4 It is there that the tribes go up,
the tribes of the Lord.

For Israel’s witness it is
to praise the name of the Lord.
5 There were set the thrones for judgment,
the thrones of the house of David.

6 For the peace of Jerusalem pray,
“May they prosper, those who love you.”
7 May peace abide in your walls,
and security be in your towers.

8 For the sake of my family and friends,
let me say, “Peace upon you.”
9 For the sake of the house of the Lord, our God,
I will seek good things for you.

Now and forever. Amen.
