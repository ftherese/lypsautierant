Psalm 19

2 The heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament proclaims the work of his hands.
3 Day unto day conveys the message,
and night unto night imparts the knowledge.

4 No speech, no word, whose voice goes unheeded;
5 their sound goes forth through all the earth,
their message to the utmost bounds of the world.

6 There he has placed a tent for the sun;
it comes forth like a bridegroom coming from his tent,
rejoices like a champion to run his course.

7 At one end of the heavens is the rising of the sun;
to its furthest end it runs its course.
There is nothing concealed from its burning heat.

8 The law of the Lord is perfect;
it revives the soul.
The decrees of the Lord are steadfast;
they give wisdom to the simple.

9 The precepts of the Lord are right;
they gladden the heart.
The command of the Lord is clear;
it gives light to the eyes.

10 The fear of the Lord is pure,
abiding forever.
The judgments of the Lord are true;
they are, all of them, just.

11 They are more to be desired than gold,
than quantities of gold.
And sweeter are they than honey,
than honey flowing from the comb.

12 So in them your servant finds instruction;
great reward is in their keeping.
13 But who can detect their own errors?
From hidden faults acquit me.

14 From presumption restrain your servant;
may it not rule me.
Then shall I be blameless,
clean from grave sin.

15 May the spoken words of my mouth,
the thoughts of my heart,
win favor in your sight, O Lord,
my rock and my redeemer!
