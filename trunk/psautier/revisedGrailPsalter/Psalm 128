Psalm 128

1 Blessed are all who fear the LORD,
and walk in his ways!
2 By the labor of your hands you shall eat.
You will be blessed and prosper.

3 Your wife like a fruitful vine
in the heart of your house;
your children like shoots of the olive
around your table.
4 Indeed thus shall be blessed
the man who fears the LORD.

5 May the LORD bless you from Sion.
May you see Jerusalem prosper
all the days of your life!
6 May you see your childrenâ€™s children.
On Israel, peace!
