Psalm 43

1 Give me justice, O God, and plead my cause
against a nation that is faithless.
From the deceitful and the cunning
rescue me, O God.

2 You, O God, are my strength;
why have you rejected me?
Why do I go mourning,
oppressed by the foe?

3 O send forth your light and your truth;
they will guide me on.
They will bring me to your holy mountain,
to the place where you dwell.

4 And I will come to the altar of God,
to God, my joy and gladness.
To you will I give thanks on the harp,
O God, my God.

5 Why are you cast down, my soul;
why groan within me?
Hope in God; I will praise him yet again,
my saving presence and my God.

Now and forever. Amen.
