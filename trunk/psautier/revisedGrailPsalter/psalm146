Psalm 124

1 “If the Lord had not been on our side,”
let Israel say—
2 “If the Lord had not been on our side
when people rose against us,
3 then would they have swallowed us alive
when their anger was kindled.

4 Then would the waters have engulfed us,
the torrent gone over us;
5 over our head would have swept
the raging waters.”

6 Blest be the Lord who did not give us
a prey to their teeth!
7 Our life, like a bird, has escaped
from the snare of the fowler.

Indeed, the snare has been broken,
and we have escaped.
8 Our help is in the name of the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

Now and forever. Amen.
