Psalm 61

2 Listen, O God, to my cry!
Attend to my prayer!
3 From the end of the earth I call you;
my heart is faint.

Set me high upon the rock
too high for me to reach,
4 you, my refuge and mighty tower
against the foe.

5 Then will I dwell in your tent forever,
and hide in the shelter of your wings.
6 For you, O God, have heard my vows;
you have given me the heritage of those
who fear your name.

7 Day upon day you will add to the king;
his years as age upon age.
8 May he ever sit enthroned before God:
bid mercy and truth be his protection.
9 So I will sing to your name forever,
and day after day fulfill my vows.

Now and forever. Amen.
