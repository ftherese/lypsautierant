Psalm 121

1 I lift up my eyes to the mountains;
from where shall come my help?
2 My help shall come from the Lord,
who made heaven and earth.

3 He will keep your foot from stumbling.
Your guard will never slumber.
4 No, he sleeps not nor slumbers,
Israelâ€™s guard.

5 The Lord your guard, the Lord your shade
at your right hand.
6 By day the sun shall not smite you,
nor the moon in the night.

7 The Lord will guard you from evil;
he will guard your soul.
8 The Lord will guard your going and coming,
both now and forever.

Now and forever. Amen.
