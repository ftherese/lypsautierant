Psalm 50

1 The God of gods, the Lord,
has spoken and summoned the earth,
from the rising of the sun to its setting.
2 Out of Sion, the perfection of beauty,
God is shining forth.

3 Our God comes, and does not keep silence.
Before him fire devours;
around him tempest rages.
4 He calls on the heavens above,
and on the earth, to judge his people.

5 “Gather my holy ones to me,
who made covenant with me by sacrifice.”
6 The heavens proclaim his justice,
for he, God, is the judge.

7 “Listen, my people, I will speak;
Israel, I will testify against you,
for I am God, your God.

8 I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices;
your offerings are always before me.
9 I do not take more bullocks from your farms,
nor goats from among your herds.

10 For I own all the beasts of the forest,
beasts in their thousands on my hills.
11 I know all the birds on the mountains;
all that moves in the field belongs to me.

12 Were I hungry, I would not tell you,
for the world and its fullness is mine.
13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls,
or drink the blood of goats?

14 Give your praise as a sacrifice to God,
and fulfill your vows to the Most High.
15 Then call on me in the day of distress.
I will deliver you and you shall honor me.”

16 But God will say to the wicked,
“How can you recite my commandments,
and take my covenant on your lips,
17 you who despise correction,
and cast my words behind you,

18 You who see a thief and befriend him,
who throw in your lot with adulterers,
19 who unbridle your mouth for evil,
and yoke your tongue to deceit,
20  you who sit and malign your own brother,
and slander your own mother’s son?

21 You do this, and should I keep silence?
Do you think that I am like you?
I accuse you, lay the charge before you.

22 Mark this, you who are forgetful of God,
lest I seize you and none can deliver you.
23 A sacrifice of praise gives me honor,
and to one whose way is blameless,
I will show the salvation of God.”

Now and forever. Amen.
