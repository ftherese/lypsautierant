Psalm 114

1 Alleluia!

When Israel came forth from Egypt,
the house of Jacob from a foreign people,
2 Judah became his temple,
Israel became his domain.

3 The sea beheld them and fled;
the Jordan turned back on its course.
4 The mountains leapt like rams,
and the hills like yearling sheep.

5 Why was it, sea, that you fled;
that you turned back, Jordan, on your course?
6 O mountains, that you leapt like rams;
O hills, like yearling sheep?

7 Tremble, O earth, before the Lord,
in the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 who turns the rock into a pool,
and flint into a spring of water.

Now and forever. Amen.
