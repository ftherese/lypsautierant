Psalm 119:129-136

129 Your decrees are wonderful indeed;
therefore my soul obeys them.
130 The unfolding of your word gives light,
and understanding to the simple.

131 I have opened my mouth and I sigh,
for I yearn for your commands.
132 Turn and have mercy on me, 
as is your rule for those who love your name.

133 Let my steps be guided by your promise;
may evil never rule me.
134 Redeem me from manâ€™s oppression,
and I will keep your precepts.

135 Let your face shine forth on your servant,
and teach me your decrees.
136 My eyes shed streams of tears,
because of those who have not kept your law.

Now and forever. Amen.
