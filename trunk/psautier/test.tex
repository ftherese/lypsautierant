1 Happy indeed \pl{is} the man 

\mi{who} follows not the coun\pl{sel} of the wic\pl{ked,} 

nor lingers in the \pl{way} of sinners 

\mi{nor} sits in the \pl{company} of scor\pl{ners,} 

2 but whose delight is the law \pl{of} the Lord 

\mi{and} who ponders his \pl{law} day and \pl{night.} 

3 Heis like a tree that \pl{is} planted 

\mi{be}\pl{side} the flowing \pl{waters,} 

that yields its fruit in due \pl{sea}-- son 

\mi{and} whose lea\pl{ves} shall never \pl{fade;} 

and all that he does \pl{shall} prosper. 

4 \mi{Not} soare the \pl{wic}ked, not \pl{so!} 

For they like \pl{winno}wed chaff 

\mi{shall} be driven a\pl{way} by the \pl{wind.} 

5 When the wicked are judged they \pl{shall} not stand, 

\mi{nor} find room among those \pl{who} are \pl{just;} 

6 for the Lord guards the way \pl{of} the just 

\mi{but} the way of the wic\pl{ked} leads to \pl{doom.}
