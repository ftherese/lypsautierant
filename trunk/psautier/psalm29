Psalm 29(28) Afferte Domino

1 O give the Lord, you sons of God,
give the Lord glory and power;
2 give the Lord the glory of his name.
Adore the Lord in his holy court.

3 The Lord's voice resounding on the waters,
the Lord on the immensity of waters;
4 the voice of the Lord, full of power,
the voice of the Lord, full of splendor.

5 The Lord's voice shattering the cedars,
the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon;
6 he makes Lebanon leap like a calf
and Sirion like a young wild ox.

7 (The Lord's voice flashes flames of fire.)

8 The Lord's voice shaking the wilderness,
the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh;
9 the Lord's voice rending the oak tree
and stripping the forest bare.

3b The God of glory thunders.
10 In his temple they all cry: "Glory!"
The Lord sat enthroned over the flood;
the Lord sits as king for ever.

11 The Lord will give strength to his people,
the Lord will bless his people with peace.
