Psalm 31(30) In te, Domine, speravi

2 In you, O Lord, I take refuge.
Let me never be put to shame.
In your justice, set me free,
3 hear me and speedily rescue me.

Be a rock of refuge for me,
a mighty stronghold to save me,
4 for you are my rock, my stronghold.
For your name's sake, lead me and guide me.

5 Release me from the snares they have hidden
for you are my refuge, Lord.
6 Into your hands I commend my spirit.
It is you who will redeem me, Lord.

/.7 O God of truth, you detest
those who worship false and empty gods.
8 As for me, I trust in the Lord:
let me be glad and rejoice in your love.

You who have seen my affliction
and taken heed of my soul's distress,
9 have not handed me over to the enemy,
but set my feet at large.

10 Have mercy on me, O Lord,
for I am in distress.
Tears have wasted my eyes,
my throat and my heart.

11 For my life is spent with sorrow
and my years with sighs.
Affliction has broken down my strength
and my bones waste away.

12 In the face of all my foes
I am a reproach,
an object of scorn to my neighbors
and of fear to my friends.

Those who see me in the street
run far away from me.
13 I am like a dead man, forgotten,
like a thing thrown away.

14 I have heard the slander of the crowd,
fear is all around me,
as they plot together against me,
as they plan to take my life.

15 But as for me, I trust in you, Lord;
I say: "You are my God.
16 My life is in your hands, deliver me
from the hands of those who hate me.

17 Let your face shine on your servant.
Save me in your love.
18 Let me not be put to shame for I call you,
let the wicked be shamed!

Let them be silenced in the grave,
19 let lying lips be dumb,
that speak haughtily against the just
with pride and contempt."

* * *

20 How great is the goodness, Lord,
that you keep for those who fear you,
that you show to those who trust you
in the sight of men.

21 You hide them in the shelter of your presence
from the plotting of men;
you keep them safe within your tent
from disputing tongues.

22 Blessed be the Lord who has shown me
the wonders of his love
in a fortified city.

23 "I am far removed from your sight"
I said in my alarm.
Yet you heard the voice of my plea
when I cried for help.

24 Love the Lord, all you saints.
He guards his faithful
but the Lord will repay to the full
those who act with pride.

25 Be strong, let your heart take courage,
all who hope in the Lord.
