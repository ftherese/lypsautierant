Psalm 3(3) Domine, quid multiplicati

2 How many are my foes, O Lord!
How many are rising up against me!
3 How many are saying about me:
"There is no help for him in God."

4 But you, Lord, are a shield about me,
my glory, who lift up my head.
5 I cry aloud to the Lord.
He answers from his holy mountain.

6 I lie down to rest, and I sleep.
I wake, for the Lord upholds me.
7 I will not fear even thousands of people
who are ranged on every side against me.

8 Arise, Lord; save me, my God,
you who strike my foes on the mouth,
you who break the teeth of the wicked!
9 O Lord of salvation, bless your people!
