Psalm 39(38) Dixi, custodiam

2 I said: "I will be watchful of my ways
for fear I should sin with my tongue.
I will put a curb on my lips
when the wicked man stands before me."
3 I was dumb, silent and still.
His prosperity stirred my grief.

4 My heart was burning within me.
At the thought of it, the fire blazed up
and my tongue burst into speech:
5 "O Lord, you have shown me my end,
how short is the length of my days.
Now I know how fleeting is my life.

6 You have given me a short span of days;
my life is as nothing in your sight.
A mere breath, the man who stood so firm,
7 a mere shadow, the man passing by;
a mere breath the riches he hoards,
not knowing who will have them."

8 And now, Lord, what is there to wait for?
In you rests all my hope.
9 Set me free from all my sins,
do not make me the taunt of the fool.
10 I was silent, not opening my lips,
because this was all your doing.

11 Take away your scourge from me.
I am crushed by the blows of your hand.
12 You punish man's sins and correct him;
like the moth you devour all he treasures.
Mortal man is no more than a breath;
13 O Lord, hear my prayer.

O Lord, turn your ear to my cry.
Do not be deaf to my tears.
In your house I am a passing guest,
a pilgrim, like all my fathers.
14 Look away that I may breathe again
before I depart to be no more.
