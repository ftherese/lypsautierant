Psalm 19(18) Caeli enarrant

2 The heavens proclaim the glory of God,
and the firmament shows forth the work of his hands.
3 Day unto day takes up the story
and night unto night makes known the message.

4 No speech, no word, no voice is heard
5 yet their span extends through all the earth,
their words to the utmost bounds of the world.

There he has placed a tent for the sun;
6 it comes forth like a bridegroom coming from his tent,
rejoices like a champion to run its course.

7 At the end of the sky is the rising of the sun;
to the furthest end of the sky is its course.
There is nothing concealed from its burning heat.

8 The law of the Lord is perfect,
it revives the soul.
The rule of the Lord is to be trusted,
it gives wisdom to the simple.

9 The precepts of the Lord are right,
they gladden the heart.
The command of the Lord is clear,
it gives light to the eyes.

10 The fear of the Lord is holy,
abiding for ever.
The decrees of the Lord are truth
and all of them just.

11 They are more to be desired than gold,
than the purest of gold
and sweeter are they than honey,
than honey from the comb.

12 So in them your servant finds instruction;
great reward is in their keeping.
13 But who can detect all his errors?
From hidden faults acquit me.

14 From presumption restrain your servant
and let it not rule me.
Then shall I be blameless,
clean from grave sin.

15 May the spoken words of my mouth,
the thoughts of my heart,
win favor in your sight, O Lord,
my rescuer, my rock!
