Psalm 1

1 Blessed indeed is the man

 who follows not the counsel of the wicked,

 nor stands in the path with sinners,

 nor abides in the company of scorners,

 2 but whose delight is the law of the LORD,

 and who ponders his law day and night.

3 He is like a tree that is planted

 beside the flowing waters,

 that yields its fruit in due season,

 and whose leaves shall never fade;

 and all that he does shall prosper.

4 Not so are the wicked, not so!

 For they, like winnowed chaff,

 shall be driven away by the wind.

5 When the wicked are judged they shall not rise,

 nor shall sinners in the council of the just;

 6 for the LORD knows the way of the just,

 but the way of the wicked will perish.
