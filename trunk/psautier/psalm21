Psalm 21(20) Domine, in virtute tua

2 O Lord, your strength gives joy to the King;
how your saving help makes him glad!
3 You have granted him his heart's desire;
you have not refused the prayer of his lips.

4 You came to meet him with the blessings of success,
you have set on his head a crown of pure gold.
5 He asked you for life and this you have given,
days that will last from age to age.

6 Your saving help has given him glory.
You have laid upon him majesty and splendor,
7 you have granted your blessings to him forever.
You have made him rejoice with the joy of your presence.

8 The king has put his trust in the Lord:
through the mercy of the Most High he shall stand firm.
9 His hand will seek and find all his foes,
his right hand find out those that hate him.

10 You will burn them like a blazing furnace
on the day when you appear.
And the Lord will destroy them in his anger;
fire will swallow them up.

11 You will wipe out their race from the earth
and their children from the sons of men.
12 Though they plan evil against you,
though they plot, they shall not prevail.

13 For you will force them to retreat;
at them you will aim with your bow.
14 O Lord, arise in your strength;
we shall sing and praise your power.
