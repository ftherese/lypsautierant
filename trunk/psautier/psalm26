Psalm 26(25) Judica me, Domine

1 Give judgment for me, O Lord:
for I walk the path of perfection.
I trust in the Lord; I have not wavered.

2 Examine me, Lord, and try me;
O test my heart and my mind,
3 for your love is before my eyes
and I walk according to your truth.

4 I never take my place with liars
and with hypocrites I shall not go.
5 I hate the evil-doer's company:
I will not take my place with the wicked.

6 To prove my innocence I wash my hands
and take my place around your altar,
7 singing a song of thanksgiving,
proclaiming all your wonders.

8 O Lord, I love the house where you dwell,
the place where your glory abides.

9 Do not sweep me away with sinners,
nor my life with bloodthirsty men
10 in whose hands are evil plots,
whose right hands are filled with gold.

11 As for me, I walk the path of perfection.
Redeem me and show me your mercy.
12 My foot stands on level ground:
I will bless the Lord in the assembly.
