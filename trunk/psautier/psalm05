Psalm 5(5) Verba mea auribus

2 To my words give ear, O Lord,
give heed to my groaning.
3 Attend to the sound of my cries,
my King and my God.

4 It is you whom I invoke, O Lord.
In the morning you hear me;
in the morning I offer you my prayer,
watching and waiting.

5 You are no God who loves evil;
no sinner is your guest.
6 The boastful shall not stand their ground
before your face.

7 You hate all who do evil;
you destroy all who lie.
The deceitful and bloodthirsty man
the Lord detests.

8 But I through the greatness of your love
have access to your house.
I bow down before your holy temple,
filled with awe.

9 Lead me, Lord, in your justice,
because of those who lie in wait;
make clear your way before me.

10 No truth can be found in their mouths,
their heart is all mischief,
their throat a wide-open grave,
all honey their speech.

11 Declare them guilty, O God.
Let them fail in their designs.
Drive them out for their many offenses,
for they have defied you.

12 All those you protect shall be glad
and ring out their joy.
You shelter them; in you they rejoice,
those who love your name.

13 It is you who bless the just man
you surround him with favor as with a shield.
