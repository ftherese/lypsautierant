Psalm 34(33) Benedicam Dominum

2 I will bless the Lord at all times,
his praise always on my lips;
3 in the Lord my soul shall make its boast.
The humble shall hear and be glad.

4 Glorify the Lord with me.
Together let us praise his name.
5 I sought the Lord and he answered me;
from all my terrors he set me free.

6 Look towards him and be radiant;
let your faces not be abashed.
7 This poor man called, the Lord heard him
and rescued him from all his distress.

8 The angel of the Lord is encamped
around those who revere him, to rescue them.
9 Taste and see that the Lord is good.
He is happy who seeks refuge in him.

10 Revere the Lord, you his saints.
They lack nothing, those who revere him.
11 Strong lions suffer want and go hungry
but those who seek the Lord lack no blessing.

12 Come, children, and hear me
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.
13 Who is he who longs for life
and many days, to enjoy his prosperity?

14 Then keep your tongue from evil
and your lips from speaking deceit.
15 Turn aside from evil and do good;
seek and strive after peace.

16 The Lord turns his face against the wicked
to destroy their remembrance from the earth.
17 The Lord turns his eyes to the just
and his ears to their appeal.

18 They call and the Lord hears
and rescues them in all their distress.
19 The Lord is close to the broken-hearted;
those whose spirit is crushed he will save.

20 Many are the trials of the just man
but from them all the Lord will rescue him.
21 He will keep guard over all his bones,
not one of his bones shall be broken.

22 Evil brings death to the wicked;
those who hate the good are doomed.
23 The Lord ransoms the souls of his servants.
Those who hide in him shall not be condemned.
