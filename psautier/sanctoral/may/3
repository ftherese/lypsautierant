MAY 3
STS. PHILIP AND JAMES
Apostles
Feast
From the common of apostles during the Easter Season p.    except:

PRAYER:
O God, who gladden us each year
with the feast day of the Apostles Philip and James,
grant us, through their prayers,
a share in the Passion and Resurrection
of your Only Begotten Son,
so that we may merit to behold you for eternity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

BENEDICTUS: Philip found Nathanael and said to him: We have found
the man Moses wrote of in the law, the one of whom the prophets
spoke. He is Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth, alleluia.

MAGNIFICAT: If you live in me and my words live in you, all you ask
for will be yours, alleluia.
