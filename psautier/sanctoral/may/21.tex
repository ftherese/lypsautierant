Almighty and eternal God,
who made the Priest Saint Christopher Magallanes and his companions
faithful to Christ the King even to the point of martyrdom,
grant us, through their intercession,
that, persevering in confession of the true faith,
we may always hold fast to the commandments of your love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
