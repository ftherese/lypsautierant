\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
O God, who gladden us each year
with the feast day of the Apostles Philip and James,
grant us, through their prayers,
a share in the Passion and Resurrection
of your Only Begotten Son,
so that we may merit to behold you for eternity.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}

the man Moses wrote of in the law, the one of whom the prophets
spoke. He is Jesus, son of Joseph, from Nazareth, alleluia.\\}
 
\hangindent=\parindent \small{MAGNIFICAT  If you live in me and my words live in you, all you ask
for will be yours, alleluia.\\}
