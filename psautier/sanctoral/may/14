MAY 14
ST. MATTHIAS
Apostle
Feast
From the common of apostles p.    , Except:

PRAYER:
O God, who assigned Saint Matthias
a place in the college of Apostles,
grant us, through his intercession,
that, rejoicing at how your love has been allotted to us,
we may merit to be numbered among the elect.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

BENEDICTUS: We must choose someone who was with us all the time
that the Lord Jesus lived among us; he will take his place with us in
giving witness to the Lordâ€™s resurrection.

MAGNIFICAT: You have not chosen me but I have chosen you and have
appointed you to go forth and bear fruit, and your fruit will remain.
