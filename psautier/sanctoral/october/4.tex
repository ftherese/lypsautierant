\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
O God, by whose gift Saint Francis
was conformed to Christ in poverty and humility,
grant that, by walking in Francisâ€™ footsteps,
we may follow your Son,
and, through joyful charity,
come to be united with you.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
