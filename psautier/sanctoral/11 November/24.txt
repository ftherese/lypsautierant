Saint Andrew Dũng-L_c, Priest,
and Companions, Martyrs
Memorial

Prayer
O God, source and origin of all fatherhood,
who kept the Martyrs Saint Andrew Dũng-L_c and his companions
faithful to the Cross of your Son,
even to the shedding of their blood,
grant, through their intercession,
that, spreading your love among our brothers and sisters,
we may be your children both in name and in truth.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
