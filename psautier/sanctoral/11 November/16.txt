Prayer
O God, who made Saint Margaret of Scotland wonderful
in her outstanding charity towards the poor,
grant that through her intercession and example
we may reflect among all humanity

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

O God, who prepared a delightful dwelling for yourself
in the heart of the Virgin Saint Gertrude,
graciously bring light, through her intercession,
to the darkness of our hearts,

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
