\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
O God, who made of the Abbot Saint Bernard
a man consumed with zeal for your house
and a light shining and burning in your Church,
grant, through his intercession,
that we may be on fire with the same spirit
and walk always as children of light.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
 

\hangindent=\parindent \small{MAGNIFICAT  Bernard, eloquent doctor of the Church, friend of
Christ the Bridegroom, eminent preacher of the Virgin Motherâ€™s
glory, at Clairvaux you became the illustrious shepherd of your
followers.\\}
