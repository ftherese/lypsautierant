\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
Renew in your Church, we pray, O Lord,
the spirit with which you endowed
your Bishop Saint Augustine
that, filled with the same spirit,
we may thirst for you,
the sole fount of true wisdom,
and seek you, the author of heavenly love.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
 


\hangindent=\parindent \small{MAGNIFICAT  Late have I loved you, O Beauty ever ancient, ever new,
late have I loved you. You called, you shouted and you shattered my
deafness.\\}
