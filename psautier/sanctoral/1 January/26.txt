JANUARY 26
STS. TIMOTHY AND TITUS
Bishops
Memorial
From the common of Pastors p.   except:

O God, who adorned Saints Timothy and Titus
with apostolic virtues,
grant, through the intercession of them both,
that, living justly and devoutly in this present age,
we may merit to reach our heavenly homeland.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

BENEDICTUS Proclaim the message, insist on it in season and out of
season, refute falsehood, correct error, call to obedience, but do all
with patience and sound doctrine.



MAGNIFICAT Let us live holy and upright lives, as we wait in joyful
hope for the coming of our Savior Jesus Christ.
