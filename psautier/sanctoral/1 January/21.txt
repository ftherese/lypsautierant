JANUARY 21
ST. AGNES
Virgin and Martyr
Memorial
From the common of Martyrs, for a Virgin Martyr p.   or of Virgins p.   except:

Almighty ever-living God,
who choose what is weak in the world to confound the strong,
mercifully grant,
that we, who celebrate the heavenly birthday of your Martyr Saint Agnes,
may follow her constancy in the faith.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

LAUDS
READING 2 Cor 1:3-5 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts
us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who
are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are
comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings,
so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.

BENEDICTUS What I longed for, I now see; what I hoped for, I now
possess; in heaven I am espoused to him whom on earth I loved with
all my heart.


VESPERS
READING 1 Pet 4:13-14 Rejoice in so far as you share Christ’s sufferings,
that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If
you are reproached for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because
the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.

MAGNIFICAT: Saint Agnes raised her hands and prayed: Holy Father,
hear me. I am coming to you
