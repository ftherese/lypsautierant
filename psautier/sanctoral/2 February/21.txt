FEBRUARY 21
ST. PETER DAMIAN
Bishop and Doctor of the Church
From the common of Pastors p.  , or of Doctors p. 

Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that we may so follow the teaching and example
of the Bishop Saint Peter Damian,
that, putting nothing before Christ
and always ardent in the service of your Church,
we may be led to the joys of eternal light.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
