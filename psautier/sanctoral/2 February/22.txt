Feast
Common of the Apostles p.   except

Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that no tempests may disturb us,
for you have set us fast
on the rock of the Apostle Peter's confession of faith.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

LAUDS
READING Acts 15:7-9 Brethren, you know that in the early days God
made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should
hear the word of the gospel and believe. And God who knows the
heart bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he
did to us; and he made no distinction between us and them, but
cleansed their hearts by faith.
BENEDICTUS Th e Lord said to Simon Peter: I have prayed for you,
Peter, that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned to
me, you must strengthen the faith of your brothers.

SEXT
PSALMODY and ANTIPHONS of the day of the week
READING 1Pet 5:1-2 So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder
and a witness of the sufferings of Christ as well as a partaker in
the glory that is to be revealed. Tend the flock of God that is your
charge, not by constraint but willingly, not for shameful gain but
eagerly.

VESPERS

Christ! By his great mercy we have been born anew to a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and to an
inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in
heaven for you, who by God’s power are guarded through faith for
a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
MAGNIFICAT: You are the shepherd of Christ’s flock and the prince of
the apostles; to you Christ has entrusted the keys of the kingdom of
heaven.

who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
