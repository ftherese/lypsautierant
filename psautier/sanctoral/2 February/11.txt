FEBRUARY 11
OUR LADY OF LOURDES
From the common of the Blessed Virgin Mary p.   , except:

Grant us, O merciful God, protection in our weakness,
that we, who keep the Memorial of the Immaculate Mother of God,
may, with the help of her intercession,
rise up from our iniquities.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

BENEDICTUS Virgin Mary, radiant dawn of our salvation, the Son of
justice, the light from on high, rose from you.

MAGNIFICAT Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you; blessed are
you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.
