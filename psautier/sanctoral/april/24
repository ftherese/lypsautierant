ST. FIDELIS OF SIGMARINGEN
Priest and Martyr
From the common of one Martyr p     during the Easter season or of Pastors, p. 

PRAYER:
O God, who were pleased to award
the palm of martyrdom to Saint Fidelis
as, burning with love for you, he propagated the faith,
grant, we pray, through his intercession,
that, grounded in charity,
we may merit to know with him
the power of the Resurrection of Christ.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
