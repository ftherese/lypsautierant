I preached to you the gospel, which you received, in which you
stand, by which you are saved, if you hold it fast-unless you

I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the

the gospel of God in the face of great opposition. For our appeal
does not spring from error or uncleanness, nor is it made with
guile; but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
with the gospel, so we speak, not to please men, but to please God
who tests our hearts.}
