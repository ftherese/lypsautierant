DECEMBER 8
THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION
OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
PATRONAL FEASTDAY OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Solemnity

PRAYER:
O God, who by the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin
prepared a worthy dwelling for your Son,
grant, we pray,
that, as you preserved her from every stain
by virtue of the Death of your Son, which you foresaw,
so, through her intercession,
we, too, may be cleansed and admitted to your presence.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
