ST. VINCENT
Deacon and Martyr
From the common of one Martyr p. 

PRAYER:
Almighty ever-living God,
mercifully pour out your Spirit upon us,
so that our hearts may possess that strong love
by which the Martyr Saint Vincent
triumphed over all bodily torments.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
