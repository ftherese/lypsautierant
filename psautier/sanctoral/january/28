O God, who made Saint Thomas Aquinas
outstanding in his zeal for holiness
and his study of sacred doctrine,

and imitate what he accomplished.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

spent long hours in prayer, study and writing.

without deceit, and shared freely with others.
