PRAYER:
May your Church, O Lord, rejoice always, confident in the
intercession of the holy abbot and pastor of your people, Saint
Honorat. Since you have willed to make your Light shine on his
face, entrusting to him the charge of tracing a path in the desert for
many brothers to follow, help us to be faithful to his teaching. We
ask thisâ€¦
