Memorial
From the common of Holy Men p.     except:

Prayer
O Lord, God of our Fathers,
who bestowed on Saints Joachim and Anne this grace,
that of them should be born the Mother of your incarnate Son,
grant, through the prayers of both,
that we may attain the salvation
you have promised to your people.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.


LAUDS
READING Is 55:3 Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, that your
soul may live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my
steadfast, sure love for David.
BENEDICTUS Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; he has raised up
for us a mighty savior, born of the house of his servant David.

VESPERS
READING Rom 9:4-5 They are Israelites, and to them belong the
sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship,
and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race,
according to the flesh, is the Christ, who is God over all, blessed
for ever. Amen.
MAGNIFICAT From the noble stem of Jesse a branch has sprung, and
from this branch a beautiful flower, rich in scent, has blossomed.
