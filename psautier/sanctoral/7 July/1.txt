BLESSED JUNIPERO SERRA
(celebrated only in the United States)
Priest
From the common of Pastors p. 

O God, who by your ineffable mercy,
have been pleased through the labors
of your priest Blessed Jun√≠pero Serra
to count many American peoples within your Church,
grant by his intercession
that we may so join our hearts to you in love,
as to carry always and everywhere before all people
the image of your Only Begotten Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
