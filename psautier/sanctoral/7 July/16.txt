JULY 16
OUR LADY OF MOUNT CARMEL
Memorial
From the common of the Blessed Virgin Mary p    except:
 
Prayer
May the venerable intercession of the glorious Virgin Mary
come to our aid, we pray, O Lord,
so that, fortified by her protection,
we may reach the mountain which is Christ.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.


BENEDICTUS I have openly sought wisdom in my prayers, and it has
blossomed like early grapes.
MAGNIFICAT Mary heard the word of God and kept it; she pondered
it in her heart.
