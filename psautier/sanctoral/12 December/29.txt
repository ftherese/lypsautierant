Saint Thomas Becket, Bishop and Martyr
From the Common of Martyrs: For One Martyr p.   , or from the Common of Pastors:
For a Bishop p.

Collect
O God, who gave the Martyr Saint Thomas Becket
the courage to give up his life for the sake of justice,
grant, through his intercession,
that, renouncing our life
for the sake of Christ in this world,
we may find it in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
