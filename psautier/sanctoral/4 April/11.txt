APRIL 11
ST. STANISLAUS
Bishop and Martyr
From the common of one Martyr p.   or of Pastors p. 

O God, for whose honor the Bishop Saint Stanislaus
fell beneath the swords of his persecutors,
grant, we pray,
that we may persevere strong in faith even until death.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
