APRIL 5
ST. VINCENT FERRER
Priest
From the common of Pastors p. 

O God, who raised up the Priest Saint Vincent Ferrer
to minister by the preaching of the Gospel,
grant, we pray,
that, when the Judge comes,
whom Saint Vincent proclaimed on earth,
we may be among those blessed
to behold him reigning in heaven.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
