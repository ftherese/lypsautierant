APRIL 23
ST. GEORGE
(in England: feast)
Martyr
From the common of one Martyr during the Easter season p. 

Extolling your might, O Lord,
we humbly implore you,
that, as Saint George imitated the Passion of the Lord,
so he may lend us ready help in our weakness.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.


HYMN
Leader now on earth no longer,
Soldier of the eternal King,
Victor in the fi ght for heaven,
We thy loving praises sing.
Great Saint George, our patron, help us,
In the confl ict be thou nigh;
Help us in that battle,
Where each one must win or die.
Praise him who in deadly battle
Never shrank from foeman’s sword,
Proof against all earthly weapon,
Gave his life for Christ the Lord.
Who, when earthly war was over,
Fought, but not for earth’s renown;
Fought, and won a nobler glory,
Won the martyr’s purple crown. Amen.


Saint Adalbert, Bishop and Martyr
From the Common of Martyrs: For One Martyr during Easter Time p.   
or  from the Common of Pastors: For a Bishop p.    

O God, who bestowed the crown of martyrdom
on the Bishop Saint Adalbert,
as he burned with zeal for souls,
grant, we pray, by his prayers,
that the obedience of the flock may never fail the shepherds,
nor the care of the shepherds be ever lacking to the flock.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
