APRIL 7
ST. JOHN BAPTIST DE LA SALLE
Priest
Memorial
From the common of Pastors, p.    or of Holy Men p. 

O God, who chose Saint John Baptist de la Salle
to educate young Christians,
raise up, we pray, teachers in your Church
ready to devote themselves wholeheartedly
to the human and Christian formation of the young.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
