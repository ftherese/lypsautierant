APRIL 4
ST. ISIDORE
Bishop and Doctor of the Church
From the common of Pastors, p.    or of Doctors p. 

Graciously hear the prayers, O Lord,
which we make in commemoration of Saint Isidore,
that your Church may be aided by his intercession,
just as she has been instructed by his heavenly teaching.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
