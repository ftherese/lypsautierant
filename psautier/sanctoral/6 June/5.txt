JUNE 5
ST. BONIFACE
Bishop and Martyr
Memorial
From the common of one Martyr, p.    or of Pastors p. 

May the Martyr Saint Boniface be our advocate, O Lord,
that we may firmly hold the faith
he taught with his lips and sealed in his blood
and confidently profess it by our deeds.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
