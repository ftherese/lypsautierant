\end{center}

\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
Almighty ever-living God, we humbly implore your majesty that, just as your Only Begotten Son was presented on this day in the Temple in the substance of our flesh, so, by your grace, we may be presented to you with minds made pure. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.\\}
 
\noindent\small{\uppercase{Hymn}}\normalsize\label{proper:presentationofthelord:hymn}
\begin{verse}
Hail to the Lord who comes,\\
Comes to his temple gate,\\
Not with his angel hosts,\\
Not in his kingly state;\\!

But borne upon the throne\\
Of Mary’s gentle breast;\\
Thus to his Father’s house\\
He comes, a humble guest.\\!

The world’s true light draws near\\
All darkness to dispel,\\
The flame of faith is lit\\
And dies the power of hell.\\!

Our bodies and our souls\\
Are temples now for him,\\
For we are born of grace-\\
God lights our souls within.\\!

O Light of all the earth!\\
We light our lives with thee;\\
The chains of darkness gone\\
All sons of God are free. Amen.\\!
