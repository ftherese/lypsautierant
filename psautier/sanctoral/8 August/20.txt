AUGUST 20
ST. BERNARD
Abbot and Doctor
Feast
From the common of Doctors of the Church p. 

Collect
O God, who made of the Abbot Saint Bernard
a man consumed with zeal for your house
and a light shining and burning in your Church,
grant, through his intercession,
that we may be on fire with the same spirit
and walk always as children of light.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.


BENEDICTUS Blessed Bernard, your life, fl ooded by the splendor of
the divine Word, illumines the Church with the light of true faith
and doctrine.
MAGNIFICAT Bernard, eloquent doctor of the Church, friend of
Christ the Bridegroom, eminent preacher of the Virgin Motherâ€™s
glory, at Clairvaux you became the illustrious shepherd of your
followers.
