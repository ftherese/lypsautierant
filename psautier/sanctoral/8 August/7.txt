ST. SIXTUS II, Pope
and COMPANIONS
Martyrs
From the common of several Martyrs p. 

Prayer
By the power of the Holy Spirit,
we pray, Almighty God,
make us docile in believing the faith
and courageous in confessing it,
just as you granted Saint Sixtus and his companions
that they might lay down their lives
for the sake of your word and in witness to Jesus.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

ST. CAJETAN
Priest
From the common of Pastors p. 

Prayer
O God, who endowed the Priest Saint Cajetan
with the grace of imitating
the apostolic way of life,
grant us, through his example and intercession,
to trust in you at all times
and to seek unceasingly your Kingdom.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
