AUGUST 16
ST. STEPHEN OF HUNGARY
From the common of Holy Men p. 

Collect
Grant your Church, we pray, almighty God,
that she may have Saint Stephen of Hungary,
who fostered her growth while a king on earth,
as her glorious defender in heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
