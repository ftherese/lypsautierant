Prayer
O God, giver of that ardor of love for you
by which Saint Lawrence was outstandingly faithful in service
and glorious in martyrdom,
grant that we may love what he loved
and put into practice what he taught.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.


LAUDS
READING 2 Cor 1:3-5 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts
us in all our affl iction, so that we may be able to comfort those
who are in any affl iction, with the comfort with which we ourselves
are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christâ€™s
suff erings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.
BENEDICTUS Do not be afraid, my son, for I am with you; if you should
walk through the fi re, the fl ames will not harm you, nor will the odor
of burning cling to you.
MAGNIFICAT Blessed Lawrence said: Th e night is not dark for me; all
things shine as in the noonday light.
