ST TERESA BENEDICTA OF THE CROSS
Virgin and Martyr
From the Common of Martyrs: For a Virgin Martyr p.    ,

Prayer
God of our Fathers,
who brought the Martyr Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross
to know your crucified Son
and to imitate him even until death,
grant, through her intercession,
that the whole human race may acknowledge Christ as its Savior
and through him come to behold you for eternity.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
