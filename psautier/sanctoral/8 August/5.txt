THE DEDICATION OF THE BASILICA OF SAINT MARY MAJOR
From the common of the Blessed Virgin Mary p. 

Collect
Pardon the faults of your servants, we pray, O Lord,
that we, who cannot please you by our own deeds,
may be saved through the intercession
of the Mother of your Son and our Lord.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
