\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
O God, who called the Priest Saint Sharbel MakhlÅ«f
to the solitary combat of the desert
and imbued him with all manner of devotion,
grant us, we pray,
that, being made imitators of the Lord's Passion,
we may merit to be co-heirs of his Kingdom.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
