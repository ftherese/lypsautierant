JULY 25
ST. JAMES
Apostle
Feast
From the Common of Apostles p. 

PRAYER:
Almighty ever-living God,
who consecrated the first fruits of your Apostles
by the blood of Saint James,
grant, we pray,
that your Church may be strengthened by his confession of faith
and constantly sustained by his protection.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

LAUDS

READING: Eph 2:19-22 You are no longer strangers and sojourners,
but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the
household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the
whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in
the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of
God in the Spirit.

BENEDICTUS: Jesus took Peter, James and his brother John and led
them up a high mountain where they could be alone, and he was
transfigured before them.

VESPERS

READING: Eph 4:11-13 Godâ€™s gifts were that some should be apostles,
some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to
equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body
of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure
of the stature of the fullness of Christ.

MAGNIFICAT: Whoever wishes to be great among you must be your
servant; whoever wishes to be first among you must be the slave of
all.
