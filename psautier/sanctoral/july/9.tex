O God, who in your wonderful providence
have strengthened your Church
through the confession of the Martyrs
Saints Augustine Zhao and companions,
grant that your people,
faithful to the mission entrusted to it,
may enjoy ever greater freedom
and witness to the truth before the world.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
