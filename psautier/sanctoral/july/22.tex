O God, whose Only Begotten Son
entrusted Mary Magdalene before all others
with announcing the great joy of the Resurrection,
grant, we pray,
that through her intercession and example
we may proclaim the living Christ
and come to see him reigning in your glory.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}

to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to
God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this
world but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you
may prove what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable
and perfect.\\}

first-born among many brethren. And those whom he predestined
he also called; and those whom he called he also justified; and those
whom he justified he also glorified.\\}
