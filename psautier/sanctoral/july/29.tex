\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
Almighty ever-living God,
whose Son was pleased to be welcomed
in Saint Marthaâ€™s house as a guest,
grant, we pray,
that through her intercession,
serving Christ faithfully in our brothers and sisters,
we may merit to be received by you
in the halls of heaven.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
