Grant, almighty God,
that we may glory in the Feast of the blessed Apostle Thomas,
so that we may always be sustained by his intercession
and, believing, may have life
in the name of Jesus Christ your Son,
whom Thomas acknowledged as the Lord.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}

whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in
the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of
God in the Spirit.\\}
