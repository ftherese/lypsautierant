ST. THOMAS
Apostle
Feast (Solemnity in India)
From the common of apostles p.     except

PRAYER:
Grant, almighty God,
that we may glory in the Feast of the blessed Apostle Thomas,
so that we may always be sustained by his intercession
and, believing, may have life
in the name of Jesus Christ your Son,
whom Thomas acknowledged as the Lord.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

LAUDS

READING: Eph 2:19-22 You are no longer strangers and sojourners,
but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the
household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and
prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the
whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in
the Lord; in whom you also are built into it for a dwelling place of
God in the Spirit.

BENEDICTUS: Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed;
blessed are they who have not seen me and yet believe.

VESPERS

READING: Eph 4:11-13 Godâ€™s gifts were that some should be apostles,
some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, to
equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body
of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure
of the stature of the fullness of Christ;

MAGNIFICAT: I touched the mark of the nails with my fingers; I put my
hand into his side and said, My Lord and my God, alleluia.
