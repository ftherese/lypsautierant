NOVEMBER 4
Saint Charles Borromeo, Bishop
Memorial
From the Common of Pastors: For a Bishop p.

PRAYER:
Preserve in the midst of your people,
we ask, O Lord, the spirit with which you filled
the Bishop Saint Charles Borromeo,
that your Church may be constantly renewed
and, by conforming herself to the likeness of Christ,
may show his face to the world.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
