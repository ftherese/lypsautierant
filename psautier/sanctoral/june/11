Apostle
Memorial
From the common of apostles , p.    except:

PRAYER:
O God, who decreed that Saint Barnabas,
a man filled with faith and the Holy Spirit,
should be set apart to convert the nations,
grant that the Gospel of Christ,
which he strenuously preached,
may be faithfully proclaimed by word and by deed.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.

BENEDICTUS: Barnabas set out for Tarsus to look for Paul. Once he
found him, he brought him to Antioch where they met with the
church and instructed a great number of people (alleluia).

MAGNIFICAT: Th e whole assembly fell silent, and they listened to
Barnabas and Paul describing all the signs and wonders God had
worked through them among the Gentiles (alleluia).
