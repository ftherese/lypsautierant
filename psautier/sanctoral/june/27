ST. CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA
Bishop and Doctor
From the common of Pastors, p.    or of Doctors of the Church p. 

PRAYER:
O God, who made the Bishop Saint Cyril of Alexandria
an invincible champion of the divine motherhood
of the most Blessed Virgin Mary,
grant, we pray,
that we, who believe she is truly the Mother of God,
may be saved through the Incarnation of Christ your Son.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.
