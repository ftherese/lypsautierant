\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
O God, who willed that your Word
should take on the reality of human flesh
in the womb of the Virgin Mary,
grant, we pray,
that we, who confess our Redeemer to be God and man,
may merit to become partakers even in his divine nature.
Who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
 

\noindent\small{\uppercase{Hymn}}\normalsize\label{annunciation:hymn}
\begin{verse}
Behold the dawn before the day,\\
Behold the Virginal Mother,\\
The woman promised from the beginning.\\
She has built her dwelling in the will of the Father.\\!

No fear, no denial,\\
Troubles the work of grace;\\
Her heart is filled with untold willingness,\\
She offers to God the silence in which the Word dwells.\\!

Behold the Virgin Spouse,\\
Mary, servant and Sovereign,\\
Who secretly bears the worldâ€™s salvation.\\
The Spirit overshadows her; the blood of Christ redeems her. Amen.\\!
