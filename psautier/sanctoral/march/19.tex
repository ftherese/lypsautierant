\hangindent=\parindent \small{PRAYER 
Grant, we pray, almighty God,
that by Saint Joseph’s intercession
your Church may constantly watch over
the unfolding of the mysteries of human salvation,
whose beginnings you entrusted to his faithful care.
Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son,
who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, for ever and ever.\\}
 
\noindent\small{\uppercase{Hymn}}\normalsize\label{proper:josephSpouse:hymn}
\begin{cverse}
Joseph, the scriptures love to trace\\
Th e glories of thy kingly line;\\
Yet no succesion of thy race,\\
No long posterity was thine -\\!

Of her the everlasting spouse\\
Who must a Virgin ever be\\
The Faithful ruler of his house\\
Who owns no fatherhood in thee.\\!

There were no songs of old renown,\\
No crowds to greet you when you came,\\
Two wanderers, to your native town,\\
Th at lost inheritance to claim;\\!

But hard the hearts, and cold the air,\\
And mean the lodging where you lay,\\
And long the exile you must bear\\
Till upstart Herod’s dying day.\\!

Joseph, the Church of God protect;\\
Her priests with holy care endow;\\
Shield of the virgin-souls elect,\\
Hope of the fatherless, be thou:\\!

And, when our parting spirits cling\\
To earthly joys that cannot bide,\\
Make Nazareth in our homes, and bring\\
Jesus and Mary to our side. Amen.\\!
\end{cverse}
