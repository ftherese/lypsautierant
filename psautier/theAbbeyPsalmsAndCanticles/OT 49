10 Héar the wórd of the Lórd, O nátions;
decláre it to the dístant ísles and sáy,
"He who scáttered Ísrael will gáther him
and guárd him as a shépherd his flóck."
11 For the Lórd has ránsomed Jácob,
redéemed him from a hánd too stróng for him.

12 They shall cóme and sing práise on the héights of Zíon,
come stréaming to the bóunty of the Lórd —
to the gráin and the wíne and the óil,
to the yéarlings of the flóck and the hérd.
Their sóul shall be like a wátered gárden,
and théy shall lánguish no móre.

Then the máiden shall rejóice in a dánce,
the young mén and óld togéther.
"I will chánge their móurning into jóy;
I will consóle them, giving gládness for sórrow.
14 I will fíll with rich fáre the sóul of my príests,
and my péople shall be fílled with my bóunty."
