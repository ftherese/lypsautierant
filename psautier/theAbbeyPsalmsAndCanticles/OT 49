10 Hear the word of the Lord, O nations;
declare it to the distant isles and say,
"He who scattered Israel will gather him
and guard him as a shepherd his flock."
11 For the Lord has ransomed Jacob,
redeemed him from a hand too strong for him.

12 They shall come and sing praise on the heights of Zion,
come streaming to the bounty of the Lord —
to the grain and the wine and the oil,
to the yearlings of the flock and the herd.
Their soul shall be like a watered garden,
and they shall languish no more.

Then the maiden shall rejoice in a dance,
the young men and old together.
"I will change their mourning into joy;
I will console them, giving gladness for sorrow.
14 I will fill with rich fare the soul of my priests,
and my people shall be filled with my bounty."
