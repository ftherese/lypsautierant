10 Behóld, the Lord Gód cómes with míght,
and his árm is rúling for him;
behóld, his rewárd is wíth him,
and his récompense befóre him.

11 Like a shépherd he féeds his flóck;
he gáthers the lámbs in his árms,
and in his bósom he cárries them;
he géntly léads the éwes.

12 Whó can measure óut the wáters with his hánd,
and márk out the héavens with a spán,
and gáuge the eárth's dúst with a méasure,
and wéigh the móuntains with scáles,
and the hílls with a bálance?

13 Whó has dirécted the Spírit of the Lórd,
or whó has táught him as his cóunselor?
14 Whóm did he consúlt to gáin understánding,
and who táught him in the páth of júdgment,
and whó could téach him knówledge,
and make knówn to him the wáy of understánding?

15 Behóld, the nátions are but a dróp from a búcket,
and are réckoned as dúst on the scáles;
behóld, he lifts úp the íslands like fíne pówder.
16 There is not enóugh in Lébanon to búm,
nor its béasts enóugh for whóle burnt ófferings.

17 Áll the nátions are as nóthing to him;
as émptiness and nóthing he accóunts them.
