10 Behold, the Lord God comes with might,
and his arm is ruling for him;
behold, his reward is with him,
and his recompense before him.

11 Like a shepherd he feeds his flock;
he gathers the lambs in his arms,
and in his bosom he carries them;
he gently leads the ewes.

12 Who can measure out the waters with his hand,
and mark out the heavens with a span,
and gauge the earth's dust with a measure,
and weigh the mountains with scales,
and the hills with a balance?

13 Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord,
or who has taught him as his counselor?
14 Whom did he consult to gain understanding,
and who taught him in the path of judgment,
and who could teach him knowledge,
and make known to him the way of understanding?

15 Behold, the nations are but a drop from a bucket,
and are reckoned as dust on the scales;
behold, he lifts up the islands like fine powder.
16 There is not enough in Lebanon to bum,
nor its beasts enough for whole burnt offerings.

17 All the nations are as nothing to him;
as emptiness and nothing he accounts them.
