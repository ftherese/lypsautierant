1 Who is this that comes from Edom,
clothed in crimson garments from Bozrah,
he who is majestic in attire,
marching in the greatness of his strength?

"It is I, announcing vindication,
who am mighty to save."
2 Why is your clothing so red,
your garments like one who treads the winepress?

3 "I have trodden the winepress all alone;
among the peoples, no one was with me.
I trod them down in my anger,
trampled them in my wrath;
upon my garments is sprinkled their blood,
and all my clothing was stained.

4 For in my heart was a day of vengeance,
but my year of redemption has arrived.
5 I looked, but there was no one to help;
I was appalled, but there was no one with relief.
So my own arm brought about my salvation,
and my own wrath upheld me."
