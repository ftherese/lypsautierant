1 Who is thís that cómes from Édom,
clóthed in crimson gárments from Bózrah,
hé who is majéstic in attíre,
márching in the gréatness of his stréngth?

"It is Í, annóuncing vindicátion,
who am míghty to sáve."
2 Whý is your clóthing so réd,
your gárments like one who tréads the wínepress?

3 "I have tródden the wínepress all alóne;
among the péoples, nó one was wíth me.
I tród them dówn in my ánger,
trámpled them in my wráth;
upon my gárments is sprínkled their blóod,
and all my clóthing was stáined.

4 For in my héart was a dáy of véngeance,
but my yéar of redémption has arríved.
5 I lóoked, but there was nó one to hélp;
I was appálled, but there was nó one with relíef.
So my ówn árm brought abóut my salvátion,
and my own wráth uphéld me."
