OT 2
1 Let us síng to the Lórd who has glóriously tríumphed;
hórse and ríder he has húrled into the séa.

2 The Lórd is my stréngth and míght;
he has becóme my salvátion.
This is my Gód, and I will práise him,
my fáther's Gód, and I will exált him.

3 The Lórd is a wárrior; the Lórd is his náme.
4 The cháriots of Pháraoh and his ármy
he has cást into the séa;
the elíte of his ófficers were drówned in the Red Séa.

5 The wáters of the flóod covered óver them;
they went dówn to the dépths like a stóne.
6Your ríght hand, O Lórd, majéstic in pówer;
your ríght hand, O Lóro, shátters the énemy.

17 You will bríng them ín and plánt them
upon the móunt of your inhéritance:
the place which yóu, O Lórd, have made your dwélling,
the holy pláce, O Lórd, that your hánds have estáblished.

18 The Lord will réign foréver and éver.
