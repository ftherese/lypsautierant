OT 2
1 Let us sing to the Lord who has gloriously triumphed;
horse and rider he has hurled into the sea.

2 The Lord is my strength and might;
he has become my salvation.
This is my God, and I will praise him,
my father's God, and I will exalt him.

3 The Lord is a warrior; the Lord is his name.
4 The chariots of Pharaoh and his army
he has cast into the sea;
the elite of his officers were drowned in the Red Sea.

5 The waters of the flood covered over them;
they went down to the depths like a stone.
6Your right hand, O Lord, majestic in power;
your right hand, O Loro, shatters the enemy.

17 You will bring them in and plant them
upon the mount of your inheritance:
the place which you, O Lord, have made your dwelling,
the holy place, O Lord, that your hands have established.

18 The Lord will reign forever and ever.
