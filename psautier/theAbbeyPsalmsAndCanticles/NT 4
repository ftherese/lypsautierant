3 Bléssed be the Gód and Fáther of our Lórd Jesus Chríst,

with évery spiritual bléssing in the héavens;

4 Júst as he has chósen us in hím
before the foundátion of the wórld
to be hóly and blámeless before him in lóve.

5 He déstined us for adóption
to himsélf through Jésus Chríst,
in accórd with the good pléasure of his wíll,
6 to the práise of his glórious gráce,
with which he fávored us in the Belóved.

7 In hím we have redémption through his blóod,
the forgíveness of transgréssions,
in accórd with the ríches of his gráce
8 lávished on us in all wísdom and ínsight.

9 He has made knówn to us the mýstery of his wíll
in accórd with his good pléasure,
which he set fórth in Chríst as a plán,
10 a plán for the fúllness of tímes,
to recapítulate all thíngs in hím,
things in héaven, and thíngs on éarth.
