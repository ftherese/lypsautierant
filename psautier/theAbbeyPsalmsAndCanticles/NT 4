3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has blessed us in Christ
with every spiritual blessing in the heavens;

4 Just as he has chosen us in him
before the foundation of the world
to be holy and blameless before him in love.

5 He destined us for adoption
to himself through Jesus Christ,
in accord with the good pleasure of his will,
6 to the praise of his glorious grace,
with which he favored us in the Beloved.

7 In him we have redemption through his blood,
the forgiveness of transgressions,
in accord with the riches of his grace
8 lavished on us in all wisdom and insight.

9 He has made known to us the mystery of his will
in accord with his good pleasure,
which he set forth in Christ as a plan,
10 a plan for the fullness of times,
to recapitulate all things in him,
things in heaven, and things on earth.
