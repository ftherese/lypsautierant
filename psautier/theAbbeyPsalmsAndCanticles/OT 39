15 Truly you are a God who hide yourself,
O God of Israel, the Savior.
16 All of them are shamed and disgraced;
the makers of idols leave together in disgrace.

17 Israel is saved by the Lord with everlasting salvation.
You shall not be put to shame or disgrace for all eternity.

18 For thus says the Lord, Creator of the heavens,
God himself, who formed the earth and made it firm;
not as chaos did he create it;
but formed it to be lived in:
I am the Lord, and there is no other.

19 I did not speak in secret,
in a land of darkness;
I did not say to the descendants of Jacob,
"Seek me in vain."
I the Lord speak what is just,
I declare what is upright.

20 Gather together, and come;
draw near together, you survivors of the nations;
they have no knowledge, who lift up wooden idols;
and pray to a god who cannot save.

21 Speak up and present your case;
let them take counsel together.
Who has revealed this from long ago,
foretold it of old?

Was it not I, the Lord?
There is no other god but me,
a righteous God and a Savior —
There is none except me.

22 Turn to me and be saved,
all the ends of the earth.
For I am God and there is no other.

23 By my own self I swear it,
from my mouth has righteousness gone forth,
a word that shall not return.
For to me every knee shall bow,
and every tongue shall swear an oath.

24 They will say to me, "Only in the Lord
are righteousness and strength;
all who were angry against him
shall come to him and be ashamed.
25 In the Lord all the offspring of Israel
shall be justified and exult."
