15 Trúly you are a Gód who hide yóurself,
O Gód of Ísrael, the Sávior.
16 Áll of them are shámed and disgráced;
the mákers of ídols léave together in dísgrace.

17 Ísrael is sáved by the Lórd with everlásting sálvation.
You shall nót be put to sháme or disgráce for all etérnity.

18 For thús says the Lórd, Creátor of the héavens,
Gód himsélf, who fórmed the eárth and made it fírm;
not as cháos did he creáte it;
but fórmed it to be líved in:
Í am the Lórd, and there is nó other.

19 I did nót spéak in sécret,
in a lánd of dárkness;
I did nót say to the descéndants of Jácob,
"Séek me in váin."
Í the Lórd spéak what is júst,
I decláre what is úpright.

20 Gáther togéther, and cóme;
draw néar togéther, you survívors of the nátions;
théy have no knówledge, who líft up wóoden ídols;
and práy to a gód who cánnot sáve.

21 Speak úp and presént your cáse;
lét them take cóunsel tógether.
Whó has revéaled this from lóng agó,
foretóld it of óld?

Was it not Í, the Lórd?
Thére is no óther gód but mé,
a ríghteous God and a Sávior —
There is nóne except mé.

22 Túrn to me and be sáved,
áll the énds of the éarth.
For Í am Gód and there is nó other.

23 By my ówn sélf I swéar it,
from mý mouth has ríghteousness gone fórth,
a wórd that shall nót retúrn.
For to mé every knée shall bów,
and évery tóngue shall swéar an óath.

24 They will sáy to me, "Ónly in the Lórd
are ríghteousness and stréngth;
áll who were ángry against him
shall cóme to him and be ashámed.
25 In the Lórd all the óffspring of Ísrael
shall be jústified and exúlt."
