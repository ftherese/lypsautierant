3 Great and wondrous are your works,
O Lord, Almighty God!
Just and true are your ways,
O King of the nations!

4 Who would not fear, O Lord,
and glorify your name?

For you alone are the Holy One,
for all nations will come,
and they will worship before you,
for your righteous deeds have been revealed.
