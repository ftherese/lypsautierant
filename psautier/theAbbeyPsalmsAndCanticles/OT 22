20 Blessed the man who waits upon wisdom,
and ponders her justice,
and reflects upon the ways of God.

21 He reflects on her ways in his heart,
and understands her secrets,
22 who pursues after her like a hunter,
and remains constant in her ways.

23 He gazes in through her windows,
and listens at her door.
24 He lodges near her house,
and fastens his tent peg by her walls;
25 he will pitch his tent by her,
and thus rest in a good place forever.

26 He will set his children beneath her shield
below her branches he will abide.
27 He will be sheltered from the heat by her,
and he will rest in her abundance.
