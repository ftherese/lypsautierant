20 Bléssed the mán who wáits upon wísdom,
and pónders her jústice,
and reflécts upon the wáys of Gód.

21 He reflécts on her wáys in his héart,
and understánds her sécrets,
22 who pursúes after her like a húnter,
and remains cónstant in her wáys.

23 He gazes ín through her wíndows,
and lístens at her dóor.
24 He lódges near her hóuse,
and fástens his tént peg by her wálls;
25 he will pítch his tént by her,
and thus rést in a good pláce foréver.

26 He will sét his chíldren benéath her shíeld
belów her bránches he will abíde.
27 He will be shéltered from the héat by hér,
and he will rést in her abúndance.
