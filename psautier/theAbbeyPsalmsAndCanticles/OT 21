16:20 You nóurished your péople with the fóod of ángels
and fúrnished them with bréad from héaven,
réady to hánd, untóiled-for,
endówed with áll delíghts
and confórming to évery táste.

21 For your provísion mánifested your swéetness toward your chíldren,
and serving the desíre of the óne who recéived it
transfórmed itself to éach one's táste.

26 Thís was só that your chíldren,
whom you lóved, O Lórd,
might léarn that it is nót the prodúction of cróps
that nóurishes your péople,
but your wórd is what sustáins those who trúst in you.

17:1 For gréat indéed are your júdgments,
so dífficult to expláin.
