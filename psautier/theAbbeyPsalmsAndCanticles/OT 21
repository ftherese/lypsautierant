16:20 You nourished your people with the food of angels
and furnished them with bread from heaven,
ready to hand, untoiled-for,
endowed with all delights
and conforming to every taste.

21 For your provision manifested your sweetness toward your children,
and serving the desire of the one who received it
transformed itself to each one's taste.

26 This was so that your children,
whom you loved, O Lord,
might learn that it is not the production of crops
that nourishes your people,
but your word is what sustains those who trust in you.

17:1 For great indeed are your judgments,
so difficult to explain.
