24 I will take you from the nations,
and gather you from all the lands,
and bring you onto your own soil.

25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you;
you shall be cleansed of all your impurity
and of all your idols I will cleanse you.

26 And I will give you a new heart,
and a new spirit I will place within you.
I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh,
and I will give you a heart of flesh.

27 I will place my Spirit within you
and make you walk according to my statutes;
and my judgments you shall keep and observe.

28 Then you shall dwell in the land I gave your ancestors,
and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
