24 I will táke you from the nátions,
and gáther you from áll the lánds,
and bríng you ónto your own sóil.

25 Then I will sprínkle clean wáter on yóu;
you shall be cléansed of áll your impúrity
and of áll your ídols I will cléanse you.

26 And I will gíve you a néw héart,
and a new spírit I will pláce withín you.
I will remóve the héart of stóne from your flésh,
and I will gíve you a héart of flésh.

27 I will pláce my Spírit withín you
and make you wálk accórding to my státutes;
and my júdgments you shall kéep and obsérve.

28 Thén you shall dwéll in the lánd I gave your áncestors,
and yóu shall be my péople, and Í will be your Gód.
