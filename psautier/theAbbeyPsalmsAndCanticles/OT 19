1 O Gód of my áncestors, Lord of mércy,
who by your wórd have máde all thíngs,
2 and in your wísdom have estáblished mán
to be máster of the créatures you have máde,

3 To góvern the wórld in hóliness and ríghteousness,
and to pass júdgment with an úpright héart,
4 grant me wísdom, the cónsort of your thróne,
and rejéct me nót from your chíldren.

5 For I am your sérvant, the són ot your hándmaid,
a mán who is wéak and short-líved,
young in understánding of júdgment and láw;
6 though one be pérfect among the chíldren of Ádam,
yet if wísdom from yóu be not wíth him,
he shall be regárded as nóthing.

9 With you is wísdom who knóws your wórks,
who was présent when you máde the wórld,
and comprehénds what is pléasing in your éyes,
and what is ríght in accórd with your commánds.

10 O send her fórth from the hóly héavens;
from the thróne of your glóry dispátch her,
that she may bé with me and lábor at my síde,
and I may knów what is pléasing to yóu.

11 For she knóws and understánds all thíngs,
and she will prúdently guíde me in my áctions,
and will keep guárd over me with her glóry.
