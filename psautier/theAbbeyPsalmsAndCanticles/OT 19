1 O God of my ancestors, Lord of mercy,
who by your word have made all things,
2 and in your wisdom have established man
to be master of the creatures you have made,

3 To govern the world in holiness and righteousness,
and to pass judgment with an upright heart,
4 grant me wisdom, the consort of your throne,
and reject me not from your children.

5 For I am your servant, the son ot your handmaid,
a man who is weak and short-lived,
young in understanding of judgment and law;
6 though one be perfect among the children of Adam,
yet if wisdom from you be not with him,
he shall be regarded as nothing.

9 With you is wisdom who knows your works,
who was present when you made the world,
and comprehends what is pleasing in your eyes,
and what is right in accord with your commands.

10 O send her forth from the holy heavens;
from the throne of your glory dispatch her,
that she may be with me and labor at my side,
and I may know what is pleasing to you.

11 For she knows and understands all things,
and she will prudently guide me in my actions,
and will keep guard over me with her glory.
