6 You will be called priests of the Lord,
spoken of as ministers of our God;
you will delight in the wealth of nations
and you will glory in their riches.

7 Instead of your shame, a double portion will be theirs,
and instead of disgrace, rejoicing will be theirs.
Therefore in your land, they will possess a double portion;
everlasting joy shall be theirs.

8 For I, I the Lord, love justice,
I hate theft and a dishonest burnt offering;
I will faithfully give them their re "A,
and I will make an eternal covenant with them.

9 And their descendants shall be known among the nations,
and their offspring amidst the peoples.
All who see them shall acknowledge them
as the generation whom the Lord has blessed.
