6 Yóu will be called príests of the Lórd,
spóken of as mínisters of our Gód;
you will delíght in the wéalth of nátions
and you will glóry in their ríches.

7 Instead of your sháme, a dóuble pórtion will be théirs,
and instead of disgráce, rejóicing will be theirs.
Therefore in your lánd, they will posséss a double pórtion;
everlásting jóy shall be théirs.

8 For Í, I the Lórd, love jústice,
I hate théft and a dishónest burnt óffering;
I will fáithfully gíve them their ré "A,
and I will máke an etérnal cóvenant with them.

9 And their descéndants shall be knówn among the nátions,
and their óffspring amídst the péoples.
All who sée them shall acknówledge them
as the generátion whom the Lórd has bléssed.
