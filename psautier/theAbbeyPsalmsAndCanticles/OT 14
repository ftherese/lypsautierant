1 Begin a song to my God with tambourines;
sing to my Lord with cymbals.
Improvise a new song for him;
extol and invoke his name.

2 You are God who suppress wars,
who pitch camp in the midst of your people
to free me from the hands of my pursuers.

13 I will sing a new song to my God:
O Lord, you are great and glorious,
marvelous in strength and invincible.

14 May all your creatures serve you,
for you spoke, and they were made.
You sent forth your Spirit, and they were created;
and no one can resist your voice.

15 For the mountains shall be shaken to their bases like the waters;
rocks shall melt like wax before your face.
Yet to those who fear you, you will still show mercy.
