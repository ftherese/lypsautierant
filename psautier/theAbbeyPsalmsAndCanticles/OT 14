1 Begin a sóng to my Gód with tambourínes;
síng to my Lórd with cýmbals.
Ímprovise a new sóng for hím;
extól and invóke his náme.

2 You are Gód who suppréss wárs,
who pitch cámp in the mídst of your péople
to frée me from the hánds of my pursúers.

13 I will síng a new sóng to my Gód:
O Lórd, you are gréat and glórious,
márvelous in stréngth and invíncible.

14 May áll your créatures sérve you,
for you spóke, and they were máde.
You sent fórth your Spírit, and they were creáted;
and nó one can resíst your vóice.

15 For the móuntains shall be sháken to their báses like the wáters;
rócks shall melt like wáx before your fáce.
Yet to thóse who féar you, you will still show mércy.
