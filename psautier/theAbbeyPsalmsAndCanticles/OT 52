26 Blessed are you, O Lord, God of our ancestors,
worthy of praise, and glorious forever is your name.
27 For you are just in all you have done for us.

29 Indeed, we have sinned and transgressed
by departing from you;
we have failed in everything.

34 For the sake of your name, do not abandon us forever,
nor annul your covenant;
35 do not withdraw your mercy from us,
for the sake of Abraham your beloved,
Isaac your servant, and Israel your holy one,
36 to whom you promised to multiply their offspring
as the stars of heaven and the sand on the seashore.

37 For we are reduced beyond any other nation,
and in all the world we are humbled this day,
O Lord, on account of our sins.

38 And in our day there is no prince, or prophet, or leader,
no holocaust, sacrifice, oblation, or incense,
no place to offer first fruits before you and find mercy.

39 But with contrite soul and humble spirit
may we be accepted,
as though with holocausts of rams and bulls,
or tens of thousands of fattened lambs.

40 So may our sacrifice be in your presence today,
as we follow you wholeheartedly;
for those who trust in you will not be put to shame.
41 And now we follow you with all our heart;
we fear you and we seek your face.
