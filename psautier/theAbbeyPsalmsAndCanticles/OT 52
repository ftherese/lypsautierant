26 Bléssed are yóu, O Lórd, Gód of our áncestors,
worthy of práise, and glórious foréver is your náme.
27 For you are júst in áll you have dóne for us.

29 Indéed, we have sínned and transgréssed
by depárting from yóu;
we have fáiled in éverything.

34 For the sáke of your náme, do not abándon us foréver,
nor annúl your cóvenant;
35 do not withdráw your mércy from us,
for the sáke of Ábraham your belóved,
Ísaac your sérvant, and Ísrael your hóly one,
36 to whóm you prómised to múltiply their óffspring
as the stárs of héaven and the sánd on the séashore.

37 For we are redúced beyónd any other nátion,
and in áll the wórld we are húmbled this dáy,
O Lórd, on accóunt of our síns.

38 And in our dáy there is no prínce, or próphet, or léader,
no hólocaust, sácrifice, oblátion, or íncense,
no place to óffer first frúits befóre you and find mércy.

39 But with contríte sóul and húmble spírit
may wé be accépted,
as though with hólocausts of ráms and búlls,
or téns of thóusands of fáttened lámbs.

40 Só may our sácrifice be in your présence todáy,
as we fóllow you wholehéartedly;
for thóse who trúst in you will nót be put to sháme.
41 And now we fóllow you with áll our héart;
we féar you and we séek your fáce.
