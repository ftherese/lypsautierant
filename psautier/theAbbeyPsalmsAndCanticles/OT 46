2 Hear the word of the Lord,
all you people of Judah,
you that enter these gates to worship the Lord.

3 Thus says the Lord of hosts,
the God of Israel:
Amend your ways and your deeds,
and let me dwell with you in this place.

4 Do not trust in these deceptive words:
"This is the temple of the Lord,
the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.”

5 For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds
if you truly act justly one with another,
6 if you do not oppress the foreigner,
the orphan, and the widow,

Or shed innocent blood in this place,
and if you do not go after other gods
to your own demise,

7 Then I will dwell with you in this place,
in the land that I gave of old
to your ancestors forever and ever.
