17 Have mercy on your people called by your name:
Israel, whom you likened to your first-born.
18 Take pity on your holy city:
Jerusalem, the place where you rest.
19 Fill Zion with your majesty,
and your temple with your glory.

20 Bear witness to your deeds of old;
fulfill the prophecy spoken in your name.
21 Reward those who wait for you;
and let your prophets be confirmed as true.

22 Hear, O Lord, the prayer of your servants,
who are ever gracious toward your people;
and guide us on the path of justice.
Then all on earth will know
that you are the eternal God.
