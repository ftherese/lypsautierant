13 Lísten to me, fáithful chíldren,
and blóssom like a róse,
grówing by a stréam of wáter.
14 As íncense, send out a swéet frágrance,
break ópen with blóssoms like a líly.

Sing óut a sóng of práise,
bléss the Lórd for áll his wórks.

15 Decláre the májesty of his náme,
and give thánks to him with práise,
with sóngs of your líps and the lýre,
sing óut with jóy as you annóunce:
16 "All of the wórks of the Lórd are very góod."
