13 Listen to me, faithful children,
and blossom like a rose,
growing by a stream of water.
14 As incense, send out a sweet fragrance,
break open with blossoms like a lily.

Sing out a song of praise,
bless the Lord for all his works.

15 Declare the majesty of his name,
and give thanks to him with praise,
with songs of your lips and the lyre,
sing out with joy as you announce:
16 "All of the works of the Lord are very good."
