1 The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God;
and no anguish will ever touch them.

2 In the eyes of the foolish, they seem to have died;
and their departure was deemed a disaster,
3 and their going forth from us a destruction,
but they are at peace.

4 For if before others, indeed, they were punished,
their hope is full of immortality.
5 And having been chastened a little,
they will be greatly blessed,
for God tested them, and found them worthy of himself.

6 For like gold in the furnace he tested them,
and accepted them as a whole burnt offering.
