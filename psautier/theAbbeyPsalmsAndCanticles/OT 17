1 The sóuls of the ríghteous are in the hánds of Gód;
and no anguísh will ever tóuch them.

2 In the éyes of the fóolish, they seem to have díed;
and their depárture was déemed a disáster,
3 and their going fórth from us a destrúction,
but théy are at péace.

4 For if before óthers, indéed, they were púnished,
their hópe is fúll of immortálity.
5 And having been chástened a líttle,
they will be gréatly bléssed,
for God tésted them, and found them wórthy of himsélf.

6 For like góld in the fúrnace he tésted them,
and accépted them as a whóle burnt óffering.
