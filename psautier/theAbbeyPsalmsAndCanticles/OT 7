35 The dáy of their rúin is at hánd;
and their dóom befálls them swíftly.
36 Indéed, the Lord will vindícate his péople;
and he will have cómpassion on his sérvants.

39 Sée now that Í, yes Í, am hé;
there is no óther gód besides mé.
I deal déath and I impárt lífe;
I have wóunded and nów I héal.

41 When I have shárpened my gléaming swórd
and my hánd takes hóld for júdgment,
I will inflíct véngeance on my fóes,
and will déal with thóse who háte me.
