35 The day of their ruin is at hand;
and their doom befalls them swiftly.
36 Indeed, the Lord will vindicate his people;
and he will have compassion on his servants.

39 See now that I, yes I, am he;
there is no other god besides me.
I deal death and I impart life;
I have wounded and now I heal.

41 When I have sharpened my gleaming sword
and my hand takes hold for judgment,
I will inflict vengeance on my foes,
and will deal with those who hate me.
