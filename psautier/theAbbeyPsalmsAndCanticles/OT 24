8 Blessed the rich man found without blame,
who has not gone after gold,
who has not hoped in money or treasures.

9 Who is he that we may praise him?
For he of all his people has done wonders.
10 Who is he that has been tested and come off perfect?
This remains his eternal glory:

He could have sinned but did not,
could have done evil, but would not,
11 so that his good works are secure in the Lord,
and the assembly of all the holy ones recounts his deeds.
