8 Bléssed the rích man fóund without bláme,
who has nót gone áfter góld,
who has not hóped in móney or tréasures.

9 Whó is hé that we may práise him?
For hé of áll his péople has done wónders.
10 Whó is hé that has been tésted and come off pérfect?
This remáins his etérnal glóry:

He cóuld have sínned but did nót,
cóuld have done évil, but would nót,
11 so that his góod wórks are secúre in the Lórd,
and the assémbly of all the hóly ones recóunts his déeds.
