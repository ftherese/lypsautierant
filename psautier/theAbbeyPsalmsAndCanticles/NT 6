12 Let us give thanks to the Father who has made us worthy
to share the heritage of the holy ones in light.

13 He delivered us from the power of darkness
and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,
14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

15 He is the image of the invisible God,
the firstborn of all creation,
16 for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created,
things visible and invisible,
whether thrones or dominions, principalities or powers.

All were created through him and for him,
17 and he exists before all things,
and in him all things hold together.

18 He is the head of the body, the Church,
the beginning, the firstborn from the dead
19 that he may have primacy in all things.

For in him all the fullness was pleased to dwell,
20 and through him, to reconcile all things to himself,
both those on the earth, and those in the heavens,
making peace through the blood of his cross.
