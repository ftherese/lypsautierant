12 Let us give thánks to the Fáther who has máde us wórthy
to sháre the héritage of the hóly ones in líght.

13 He delívered us from the pówer of dárkness
and tránsferred us to the kíngdom of his belóved Són,
14 in whóm we have redémption, the forgíveness of síns.

15 Hé is the ímage of the invísible Gód,
the fírstborn of all creátion,
16 for in hím all things in héaven and on éarth were creáted,
things vísible and invísible,
whether thrónes or domínions, principálities or pówers.

Áll were creáted thróugh him and fór him,
17 and he exísts befóre all thíngs,
and in hím all thíngs hold togéther.

18 Hé is the héad of the bódy, the Chúrch,
the begínning, the fírstborn from the déad
19 that hé may have prímacy in áll things.

For in hím all the fúllness was pléased to dwéll,
20 and through hím, to réconcile all thíngs to himsélf,
both thóse on the éarth, and thóse in the héavens,
making péace through the blóod of his cróss.
