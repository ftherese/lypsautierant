1 Cóme, let us retúrn to the Lórd:
for hé himsélf has tom asúnder,
but hé will héal us.
He has strúck us dówn,
but he will bínd up our wóunds.

2 He will restóre us to lífe after twó dáys;
and on the thírd day he will ráise us úp
that we may líve in his présence.

3 Let us knów, let us stríve to knów the Lórd;
as cértain as the dáwn is his cóming.
And he will cóme to us like ráin,
like the spríng rain which renéws the éarth.

4 Whát can I dó for you, O Éphraim?
Whát can I dó for you, O Júdah?
Your fáithful lóve is like a mórning clóud,
like the déw which so éarly is góne.

5 Thát is why I strúck them dówn through the próphets,
and sléw them by the wórds of my móuth,
for my júdgment shall go fórth like the líght.

6 Behóld, I desire mércy and not sácrifice,
and knówledge of Gód, more than whóle burnt ófferings.
