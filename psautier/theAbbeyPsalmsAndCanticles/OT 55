1 Come, let us return to the Lord:
for he himself has tom asunder,
but he will heal us.
He has struck us down,
but he will bind up our wounds.

2 He will restore us to life after two days;
and on the third day he will raise us up
that we may live in his presence.

3 Let us know, let us strive to know the Lord;
as certain as the dawn is his coming.
And he will come to us like rain,
like the spring rain which renews the earth.

4 What can I do for you, O Ephraim?
What can I do for you, O Judah?
Your faithful love is like a morning cloud,
like the dew which so early is gone.

5 That is why I struck them down through the prophets,
and slew them by the words of my mouth,
for my judgment shall go forth like the light.

6 Behold, I desire mercy and not sacrifice,
and knowledge of God, more than whole burnt offerings.
