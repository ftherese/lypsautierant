OT 1

1 Let us síng to the LÓRD who has glóriously tríumphed;
horse and rider he has hurled into the sea.

2 The Lórd is my stréngth and míght;
hé has becóme my salvátion.
Thís is my Gód, and I will práise him,
my fáther's Gód, and I will exált him.

3 The LÓRD is a wárrior; the LÓRD is his náme.
4 The cháriots of Pháraoh and his ármy 
he has cást into the séa.
8 At the blást of your ánger, the wáters gáthered;
the wáves stood úp like a wáll;
the déeps congéaled in the héart of the séa.

9 The fóe sáid, "I will pursúe, will overtáke;
Í will divíde the spóil,
my sóul shall have its fíll of them.
Í will báre my swórd;
my hánd shall destróy them."

10 You bléw with your bréath, the séa cóvered them;
they sánk like léad in the míghty wáters.
11 Whó is like yóu among the góds, O LÓRD?

Whó is like yóu, majéstic in hóliness,
áwesome in spléndor, wórking wónders?
12 You strétched out your ríght hand,
the éarth swállowed them.

13 In your fáithful lóve you gúided the péople you redéemed.
In your stréngth you léd them to your hóly dwélling.

17 You will bríng them ín and plánt them
upón the móunt of your inhéritance:
the pláce which yóu, O LÓRD, have made your dwélling,
the hóly place, O LÓRD, that your hánds have estáblished.

The LÓRD will réign foréver and éver.
