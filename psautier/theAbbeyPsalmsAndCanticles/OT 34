10 I said: In the midst of my days I must depart.
I am consigned to the gates of Sheol
for the rest of my years.

11 I said, I shall not see
the Lord in the land of the living;
no more shall I look on the human race,
on those who inhabit the world.

12 My dwelling is pulled up and removed from me
I like a shepherd's tent;
! he has rolled up my life like a weaver,
who severs me from the last thread.

16 O Lord, in you my heart hopes,
my spirit lives;
heal me and give me life.
