61:10 I will gréatly rejóice in the Lórd,
and my sóul shall exúlt in my Gód;
for he has clóthed me in the gárments of salvátion,
and wrápped me in the róbe of saving jústice,
like a brídegroom adórned with a crówn,
and like a bríde bedécked with her jéwels.

11 For as the éarth brings fórth its grówth,
and a gárden makes what is sówn in it spróut up,
so the Lord Gód will make ríghteousness and práise
sprout úp in the síght of all the nátions.

62:1 For Zion's sáke I will not keep sílent,
for Jerúsalem's sake I will nót keep stíll,
until her vindicátion shines fórth like the dáwn,
and her salvátion like a flaming tórch.

2 Nátions shall behóld your vindicátion,
and every kíng your glóry;
and yóu shall be cálled by a néw náme
which the móuth of the Lórd shall decláre.

3 Yóu shall be a crówn of béauty
in the hánd of the Lórd,
and in the hánd of your Gód a royal díadem.

4 No móre shall you be cálled "Forsáken,”
nor your lánd be called "Désolate.”
But yóu shall be cálled "My Delíght is in hér,”
and your lánd "Espóused."
For the Lórd delíghts in you,
and your lánd shall be espóused.

5 For as a young mán márries a vírgin
your Búilder shall márry you;
and as a brídegroom rejóices in his bríde,
so will your Gód rejóice in yóu.
