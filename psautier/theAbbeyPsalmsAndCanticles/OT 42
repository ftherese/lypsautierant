61:10 I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,
and my soul shall exult in my God;
for he has clothed me in the garments of salvation,
and wrapped me in the robe of saving justice,
like a bridegroom adorned with a crown,
and like a bride bedecked with her jewels.

11 For as the earth brings forth its growth,
and a garden makes what is sown in it sprout up,
so the Lord God will make righteousness and praise
sprout up in the sight of all the nations.

62:1 For Zion's sake I will not keep silent,
for Jerusalem's sake I will not keep still,
until her vindication shines forth like the dawn,
and her salvation like a flaming torch.

2 Nations shall behold your vindication,
and every king your glory;
and you shall be called by a new name
which the mouth of the Lord shall declare.

3 You shall be a crown of beauty
in the hand of the Lord,
and in the hand of your God a royal diadem.

4 No more shall you be called "Forsaken,”
nor your land be called "Desolate.”
But you shall be called "My Delight is in her,”
and your land "Espoused."
For the Lord delights in you,
and your land shall be espoused.

5 For as a young man marries a virgin
your Builder shall marry you;
and as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride,
so will your God rejoice in you.
