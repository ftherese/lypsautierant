3 I cried óut to the Lórd in my dístress,
and he ánswered me.
From the bélly of Shéol I cálled,
and you héeded my vóice.

4 You cást me óut into the déep,
into the héart of the séas.
The wáters of the flóod surróunded me,
all your wáves and bíllows swept óver me.

5 Then I sáid, "I am dríven from your síght;
shall I ever behóld your hóly témple?"

8 When my sóul grew fáint withín me,
I called to mínd the Lórd.
My práyer came befóre you in your holy témple.
