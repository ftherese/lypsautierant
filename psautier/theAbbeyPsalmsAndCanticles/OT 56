3 I cried out to the Lord in my distress,
and he answered me.
From the belly of Sheol I called,
and you heeded my voice.

4 You cast me out into the deep,
into the heart of the seas.
The waters of the flood surrounded me,
all your waves and billows swept over me.

5 Then I said, "I am driven from your sight;
shall I ever behold your holy temple?"

8 When my soul grew faint within me,
I called to mind the Lord.
My prayer came before you in your holy temple.
