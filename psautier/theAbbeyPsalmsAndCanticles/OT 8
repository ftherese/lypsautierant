1 My héart exúlts in the Lórd;
my hórn is exálted in my Gód.
My móuth derídes my fóes,
as I rejoíce in your salvátion.

2 There is nó one as hóly as the Lórd;
trúly, there is nó one besídes yóu,
and there ís no róck like our Gód.

3 Spéak no móre with haughty príde,
nor let árrogance come fórth from your móuth.
For the Lórd is a Gód of knówledge,
and by hím are áctions wéighed.

4 The bóws of the míghty are bróken,
while the féeble gírd on stréngth.
5 The sáted hire themselves óut for bréad,
while the húngry húnger no móre:
The barren wífe gives bírth to séven, 
while the óne with many chíldren is désolate.

6 The Lórd deals déath and brings to lífe,
casts dówn to Shéol and raises úp.
7 Tire Lórd makes póor and makes rích;
he brings dówn lów yet lifts úp hígh.

8 He ráises the póor from the dúst,
lifts the néedy from the ásh-heap,
To gíve them a séat with nóbles,
to inhérit a thróne of glóry.

For the píllars of the éarth are the Lórds;
he has sét the wórld upón them.
9 He guárds the stéps of his fáithful ones,
but the wícked shall be sílenced in dárkness,
for not by stréngth is a wárrior made míghty.

10 The Lórd will shátter his fóes,
agáinst them will he thúnder in the héavens.
The Lord will júdge the énds of the éarth,
will endów his kíng with stréngth,
and exált the hórn of his anóinted.
