1 My heart exults in the Lord;
my horn is exalted in my God.
My mouth derides my foes,
as I rejoice in your salvation.

2 There is no one as holy as the Lord;
truly, there is no one besides you,
and there is no rock like our God.

3 Speak no more with haughty pride,
nor let arrogance come forth from your mouth.
For the Lord is a God of knowledge,
and by him are actions weighed.

4 The bows of the mighty are broken,
while the feeble gird on strength.
5 The sated hire themselves out for bread,
while the hungry hunger no more:
The barren wife gives birth to seven, 
while the one with many children is desolate.

6 The Lord deals death and brings to life,
casts down to Sheol and raises up.
7 Tire Lord makes poor and makes rich;
he brings down low yet lifts up high.

8 He raises the poor from the dust,
lifts the needy from the ash-heap,
To give them a seat with nobles,
to inherit a throne of glory.

For the pillars of the earth are the Lords;
he has set the world upon them.
9 He guards the steps of his faithful ones,
but the wicked shall be silenced in darkness,
for not by strength is a warrior made mighty.

10 The Lord will shatter his foes,
against them will he thunder in the heavens.
The Lord will judge the ends of the earth,
will endow his king with strength,
and exalt the horn of his anointed.
