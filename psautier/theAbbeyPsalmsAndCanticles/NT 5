6 Although he was in the form of God,
Christ Jesus did not regard equality with God
something to be grasped.

7 Rather he emptied himself,
taking on the form of a slave
being born in human likeness;

And found to be in human form,
8 he humbled himself,
becoming obedient unto death,
death upon a cross.

9 And for this, God highly exalted him,
and bestowed upon him the name
that is above every other name.

10 So that at the name, of Jesus
every knee shall bend
in the heavens, on the earth, and under the earth,

11 And every tongue confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord
to the glory of God the Father.
