6 Althóugh he was in the fórm of Gód,
Christ Jésus did not regárd equálity with Gód
sómething to be grásped.

7 Ráther he émptied himsélf,
taking ón the fórm of a sláve
being bórn in húman líkeness;

And fóund to be in húman fórm,
8 he húmbled himsélf,
becoming obédient unto déath,
déath upon a cróss.

9 And for thís, God híghly exálted him,
and bestówed upon him the náme
that is abóve every óther náme.

10 Só that at the náme, of Jésus
every knée shall bénd
in the héavens, on the éarth, and under the éarth,

11 And évery tóngue conféss
that Jesus Chríst is Lórd
to the glóry of Gód the Fáther.
