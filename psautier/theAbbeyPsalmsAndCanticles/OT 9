10 Blessed are you, O Lord,
God of Israel, our father,
from eternity unto eternity.

11 Yours, O Lord, is greatness and power,
splendor, victory and majesty;
for all is yours in heaven and on earth.
Yours, O Lord, is the kingdom,
you are exalted as head over all.

12 Riches and honor are from you,
and you have dominion over all.
In your hand is power and might;
your hand gives greatness and strength to all.

13 And now, our God, we give you thanks,
and we praise your splendid name.
