10 Sing to the Lord a new song,
his praise from the ends of the earth—
you who go down into the sea, and its fullness,
the islands and those who dwell there.

11 Let the desert and its cities exult,
the villages where Kedar dwells.
Let the inhabitants of Sela shout for joy;
let them sing from the tops of the mountains.
12 Let them give glory to the Lord,
and announce his praise in the islands.

13 The Lord strides forth like a champion,
like a warrior he rouses his rage;
he raises his voice and shouts aloud,
he shows his might against his foes.

14 I have always kept silent,
kept quiet, restraining myself.
Now I cry out like a woman in labor;
I both gasp and pant.

15 Mountains and lulls will I lay waste;
and all their plants will I wither.
And rivers will I turn into islands,
and cause the marshes to dry up.

16 I will lead the blind by a road they do not know;
and on paths they do not know I will lead them.
I will turn darkness into light before them,
and rough places into level ground.
