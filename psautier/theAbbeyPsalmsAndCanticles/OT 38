10 Síng to the Lórd a new sóng,
his práise from the énds of the éarth—
yóu who go dówn into the séa, and its fúllness,
the íslands and thóse who dwéll there.

11 Let the désert and its cíties exúlt,
the víllages where Kédar dwélls.
Let the inhábitants of Séla shóut for jóy;
let them síng from the tóps of the móuntains.
12 Let them give glóry to the Lórd,
and annóunce his práise in the íslands.

13 The Lórd strides fórth like a chámpion,
like a wárrior he róuses his ráge;
he ráises his vóice and shóuts alóud,
he shóws his míght against his fóes.

14 I have alwáys kept sílent,
kept quíet, restráining myself.
Now I cry óut like a wóman in lábor;
I both gásp and pánt.

15 Móuntains and lúlls will I lay wáste;
and áll their plánts will I wíther.
And rívers will I túrn into íslands,
and cáuse the márshes to dry úp.

16 I will léad the blínd by a róad they do not knów;
and on páths they do not knów I will léad them.
I will turn dárkness into líght before them,
and róugh places into lével gróund.
