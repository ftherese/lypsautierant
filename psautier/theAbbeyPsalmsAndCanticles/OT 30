1 I give thanks to you, O Lord!
For though you were angry with me,
your anger turned back, and you consoled me.

2 Behold, God is my salvation!
I will trust and will not be afraid,
for the Lord is my strength and my praise,
and he has been my salvation.

3 With joy will you draw water
from the springs of salvation.

4 And you will say on that day:
Give thanks to the Lord, invoke his name;
make known among the peoples his deeds;
proclaim that his name is exalted. 5

5 Sing to the Lord for he has wrought wonders;
let this be known through all the earth.
6 Shout aloud and sing praise, you who dwell in Zion,
for great in your midst is the Holy One of Israel.
