1 I give thánks to yóu, O Lord!
For though yóu were ángry with me,
your ánger turned báck, and you consóled me.

2 Behóld, Gód is my salvátion!
I will trúst and will nót be afráid,
for the Lórd is my stréngth and my práise,
and hé has been my salvátion.

3 With jóy will you draw wáter
from the spríngs of salvátion.

4 And yóu will sáy on that dáy:
Give thánks to the Lórd, invóke his náme;
make knówn among the péoples his déeds;
procláim that his náme is exálted. 5

5 Síng to the Lórd for he has wrought wónders;
let thís be knówn through all the éarth.
6 Shóut alóud and sing práise, you who dwéll in Zíon,
for gréat in your mídst is the Hóly One of Ísrael.
