17 Wisdom gave to holy ones
a reward for their labors;
along a marvelous way she guided them.
She became a shelter for them by day,
and a flame of stars by night.

18 Across the Red Sea she carried them,
and brought them through the watery depths,
19 yet their foes she drowned in the sea,
and then cast them up from the abyss.

20 Therefore the righteous despoiled the ungodly,
and they extolled your holy name, O Lord,
and praised your conquering hand with one voice;
21 for wisdom opened mouths that were mute
and made the tongues of infants eloquent.
