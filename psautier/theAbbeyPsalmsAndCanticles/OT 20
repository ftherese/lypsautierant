17 Wísdom gave to hóly ones
a rewárd for their lábors;
along a márvelous wáy she guíded them.
She became a shélter for them by dáy,
and a fláme of stárs by níght.

18 Acróss the Red Séa she cárried them,
and bróught them through the wátery dépths,
19 yet their fóes she drówned in the séa,
and then cást them úp from the ábyss.

20 Thérefore the ríghteous despóiled the ungódly,
and they extólled your holy náme, O Lórd,
and práised your conquering hánd with one vóice;
21 for wísdom opened móuths that were múte
and made the tóngues of ínfants éloquent.
