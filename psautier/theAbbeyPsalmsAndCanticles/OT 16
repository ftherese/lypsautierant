2:10 Arise, my beloved,
my dove, my fair one, and come.
14 For your voice is sweet,
and comely is your face.

4:8 Come from Lebanon, my bride,
9 you have ravished my heart, my sister, my bride.

11 The fragrance of your clothing
is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
12 A garden enclosed is my sister, my bride,
a garden enclosed, a fountain preserved.

15 You are a garden fountain,
a well of living water,
a stream which flows from Lebanon.
