one that keeps faith, may enter.

8 Yes, in the path of your judgments,
we wait for you, O Lord;
your name and your renown

my spirit within me seeks you at dawn.
When your judgments are wrought on earth,
the world's inhabitants learn righteousness.

12 O Lord, you order peace for us;
for you accomplished all our works for us.
