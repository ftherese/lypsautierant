7 In the time of their visitation, they will shine forth;
and they will dart about like sparks through stubble.
8 They will judge nations and rule over peoples,
and the Lord will reign over them for all time.

9 Those who trust in him will understand truth;
and the faithful will abide with him in love.
For grace and mercy remain with his holy ones,
and he watches over his elect.
