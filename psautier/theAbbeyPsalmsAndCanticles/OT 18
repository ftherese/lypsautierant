7 In the tíme of their visitátion, they will shine fórth;
and they will dart abóut like spárks through stúbble.
8 They will judge nátions and rúle over péoples,
and the Lórd will réign over them for all tíme.

9 Those who trúst in him will understánd trúth;
and the fáithful will abíde with him in lóve.
For gráce and mércy remain with his hóly ones,
and he watches óver his eléct.
