1b Bléssed be Gód, who lives foréver,
and bléssed be his kíngdom,
2 for he púnishes but álso shows mércy.

He leads dówn to the dépths of Hádes,
and brings úp from rúin by his májesty;
and nó one can escápe his hánd.

3 Chíldren of Ísrael, conféss him before the nátions,
for hé has scáttered you amóng them,
4 and even thére has shówn you his gréatness.

Extól him, thén, before every líving béing,
for hé is our Lórd and our Fáther,
hé is our Gód foréver.

5 He will púnish you for your iníquities,
but on áll of you hé will have mércy,
he will gáther you from áll the nátions
wheréver you have been scáttered.

6 When you turn báck to hím
with áll your héart and áll your sóul
to dó what is trúe before hím,
then hé will turn báck to you
and no lónger híde his fáce from you.

Nów, thén, sée what he has dóne for you,
and with fúll vóice, gíve him your thánks.
Bléss the Lórd of ríghteousness,
and exált the Kíng of the áges.

In the lánd of my éxile I give him thánks,
and show his pówer and grándeur to a nation of sínners.
Turn báck, you sínners, and do what is ríght before him.
Who knóws, he may fávor you and sin you mércy?

7 To the Kíng of héaven I speak jóyfully,
my soul rejóices all the dáys of my lífe.
8 bléss the Lórd, all yon chósen ones;
and áll, give práise to his grándeur.
Take up dáys of rejóicing and conféss him.

9 O Jerúsalem, holy cíty,
for the wórks of your hánds he will púnish you.
10 Give thánks to the Lórd with góod wórks,
and bléss the Kíng of the áges
so that his tént may be rebúilt in you with jóy.

And may he gládden all cáptives withín you;
and may he lóve all the ánguished withín you
for all generátions, foréver.

11 A brilliant líght will shíne to all the énds of the éarth;
many nátions will cóme to you from áfar,
and from áll the earth's énds to your holy náme,
bearing their gífts in their hánds for the King of héaven.

Generátion after generátion
will give jóyful práise in you,
and the náme of the chósen one will be foréver.

13 Thén you will rejóice and exúlt
over the chíldren of the ríghteous,
tor thév will áll be gathered ín
and will bléss the Lórd of the áges.
14 Bléssed are thóse who lóve you,
and bléssed those who rejóice in your frúitful péace.

15 O my sóul, bléss the Lórd, the great Kíng,
16 for Jerúsalem shall be búilt as a cíty,
his hóuse from áge to áge.
How háppy will I bé if a rémnant of my óffspring
lives ón to sée your glóry,
and profésses the Kíng of héaven.

The gátes of Jerúsalem will be máde
of sápphire and émerald,
and all your wálls of précious stónes.
The tówers of Jerúsalem will be made with góld
and their búlwarks with púre góld.

17 The stréets of Jerúsalem will be páved .
with rúby and with stónes of Óphir.
18 The very gátes of Jerúsalem will resóund
with hýmns of gládness,
and all her hóuses will shóut, Allelúia.

Bléssed be the Gód of Ísrael,
and those bléssed will práise the holy náme,
from etérnity and foréver.
