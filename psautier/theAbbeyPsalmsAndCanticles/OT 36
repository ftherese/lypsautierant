1 Comfort, give comfort to my people,
says your God.

2 Speak to the heart of Jerusalem,
and cry out to her
that her slavery is ended,
her guilt is taken away;
indeed, she has received from the hand of the Lord,
double for all her sins.

3 A voice cries out:
In the desert prepare the way of the Lord!
Make straight in the desert a highway for our God!

4 Every valley shall be raised up,
every mountain and hill be made low;
the rugged ground shall become a level plain,
the rough places become a valley.

5 Then the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
and together all flesh shall see it;
for the mouth of the Lord has spoken. 

6 A voice rings out, "Cry aloud!"
and I said, "What shall I cry aloud?"
All flesh is grass and all its beauty
is like the flower of the field.

7 The grass withers, the flower fades
when the breath of the Lord blows on them;
indeed, the people are grass.

8 The grass withers, the flower fades,
but the word of our God will stand forever.
