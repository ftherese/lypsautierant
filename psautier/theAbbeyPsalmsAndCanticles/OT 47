17 Let my eyes overflow with tears,
night and day, may they not cease,
for the virgin daughter of my people
is afflicted with a great affliction,
a most grievous wound.

18 If I go out to the field,
behold, those slain by the sword.
And if I enter the city,
behold, diseases from famine.
Both the prophet and the priest
have traversed the land without knowledge.

19 Have you rejected Judah completely?
Does your soul detest Zion?
Why have you struck us down,
with no hope of our healing?
We wait for peace, but find no good;
for a time of healing, but see, terror.

20 We acknowledge our wickedness, O Lord,
the iniquity of our ancestors,
for we have sinned against you.

21 Do not spurn us, for the sake of your name,
nor dishonor your glorious throne.
Remember! Break not your covenant with us.
