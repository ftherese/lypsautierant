21 Christ also suffered for you,
leaving you an example
that you should follow in his footsteps.

22 No sin did he commit;
no guile was found on his lips.
23 When he was insulted,
he returned no insult;

When he was made to suffer,
he made no threats;
instead he handed himself over
to the One who judges justly.

24 He himself bore our sins
in his own body on the tree
so that we might die to sin
and live for righteousness.
By his wounds you have been healed.
