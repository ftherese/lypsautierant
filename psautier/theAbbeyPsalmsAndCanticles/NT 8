NT 8

21 Christ álso súffered for yóu,
léaving yóu an exámple
that yóu should fóllow in his fóotsteps.

22 No sín did hé commít;
no guíle was fóund on his líps.
23 Whén he was insúlted,
he retúrned no ínsult;

Whén he was máde to súffer,
he máde no thréats;
instéad he hánded himself óver
to the Óne who júdges jústly.

24 He himsélf bore our síns
in his own bódy on the trée
so that wé might díe to sín
and líve for ríghteousness.
By his wóunds yóu have been héaled.
