21 Chríst also súffered for you,
léaving you an exámple
that yóu should fóllow in his fóotsteps.

22 No sín did he commít;
no guíle was fóund on his líps.
23 When hé was insúlted,
he retúrned no ínsult;

When hé was máde to súffer,
hé made no thréats;
instéad he hánded himself óver
to the Óne who júdges jústly.

24 Hé himsélf bore our síns
in his own bódy on the trée
so that wé might díe to sín
and líve for ríghteousness.
By his wóunds yóu have been héaled.
