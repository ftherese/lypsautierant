1 Have mércy on us, Gód of áll,
lóok upon us,
and shów us the líght of your mércies;

2 And sénd your féar upon the nátions
who have nót sought you óut,
that they may knów there is no Gód but yóu,
and may recóunt your wóndrous déeds.

3 Ráise your hánd over the fóreign nátions,
that théy may sée your pówer.
4 As yóu have used ús to shów them your hóliness,
so now use thém to show ús your gréatness.

5 Thús will they knów as wé have known
that there is no Gód but yóu, O Lórd.
6 Grant néw signs and accómplish further wónders,
7 make glórious your hánd, confírm your ríght arm.

13 Gather togéther all the tríbes of Jácob,
16 and restóre to them their héritage
as it wás from the begínning.

17 Have mércy on your péople cálled by your náme:
Ísrael, whom you líkened to your fírst-bom.
18 Take píty on your holy cíty:
Jerúsalem, the pláce where you rést.
19 Fill Zíon with your májesty,
and your témple with your glóry.
