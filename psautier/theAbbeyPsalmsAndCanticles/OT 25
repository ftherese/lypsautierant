1 Have mercy on us, God of all,
look upon us,
and show us the light of your mercies;

2 And send your fear upon the nations
who have not sought you out,
that they may know there is no God but you,
and may recount your wondrous deeds.

3 Raise your hand over the foreign nations,
that they may see your power.
4 As you have used us to show them your holiness,
so now use them to show us your greatness.

5 Thus will they know as we have known
that there is no God but you, O Lord.
6 Grant new signs and accomplish further wonders,
7 make glorious your hand, confirm your right arm.

13 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob,
16 and restore to them their heritage
as it was from the beginning.

17 Have mercy on your people called by your name:
Israel, whom you likened to your first-bom.
18 Take pity on your holy city:
Jerusalem, the place where you rest.
19 Fill Zion with your majesty,
and your temple with your glory.
