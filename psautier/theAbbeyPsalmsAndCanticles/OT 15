1 Wisdom has built her house;
she has hewn out her seven pillars.
2 She has prepared the banquet,
mixed the wine,
and has spread the table.

3 She has sent out her maidens
to announce from the heights:
4 "Let those without learning enter here";

To those without sense, she says,
5 "Come, eat my food
and drink the wine I have mixed;
6 give up the ways of foolishness and live;
walk in the ways of understanding."

10 Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
knowledge of the Holy One is insight.
11 It is by me that your days will increase,
and years of life will be added to you.
12If you are wise, then wisdom will be yours;
if you scoff, then you alone shall bear it.
