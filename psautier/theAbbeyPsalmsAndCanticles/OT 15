1 Wísdom has búilt her hóuse;
she has hewn óut her séven píllars.
2 She has prepáred the bánquet,
míxed the wíne,
and has spréad the táble.

3 She has sent óut her máidens
to annóunce from the héights:
4 "Let thóse without léarning enter hére";

To thóse without sénse, she sáys,
5 "Cóme, éat my fóod
and drínk the wíne I have míxed;
6 give up the wáys of fóolishness and líve;
wálk in the wáys of understánding."

10 Féar of the Lórd is the begínning of wísdom,
knówledge of the Hóly One is ínsight.
11 It is by mé that your dáys will incréase,
and yéars of lífe will be ádded to you.
12If you are wíse, then wísdom will be yóurs;
if you scóff, then you alóne shall béar it.
