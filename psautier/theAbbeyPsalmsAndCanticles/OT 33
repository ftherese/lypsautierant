13 Héar what I have dóne, O yóu who are fár óff;
and yóu who are néar, acknówledge my míght.

14 Sínners in Zíon are sháking with féar;
trémbling séizes the gódless.
"Whó of us can dwéll with the devóuring fíre;
whó of us can dwéll with everlásting flámes?"

15 The óne who walks ríghtly and spéaks hónestly,
who spúrns what is gáined by óppression,
who shákes his hánd frée lest it accépt a bríbe,
who clóses his éars not to lísten to blóodshed,
who shúts his éyes not to gáze on évil.

16 Such a óne shall dwéll upon the héights,
whose réfuge will be a rócky strónghold,
whose bréad will be gíven, and whose wáter assúred.
