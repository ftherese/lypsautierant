13 Hear what I have done, O you who are far off;
and you who are near, acknowledge my might.

14 Sinners in Zion are shaking with fear;
trembling seizes the godless.
"Who of us can dwell with the devouring fire;
who of us can dwell with everlasting flames?"

15 The one who walks rightly and speaks honestly,
who spurns what is gained by oppression,
who shakes his hand free lest it accept a bribe,
who closes his ears not to listen to bloodshed,
who shuts his eyes not to gaze on evil.

16 Such a one shall dwell upon the heights,
whose refuge will be a rocky stronghold,
whose bread will be given, and whose water assured.
