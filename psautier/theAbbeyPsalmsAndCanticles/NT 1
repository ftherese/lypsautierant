46 My sóul procláims the gréatness of the Lórd,
47 and my spírit rejóices in Gód my Sávior,
48 for he has lóoked upon his hándmaid in her lówliness;
for behóld, from thís day fórward,
all generátions will cáll me bléssed.

49 For the Almíghty has done gréat thíngs for me,
and hóly is his náme.
50 His mércy is from áge to áge
for thóse who féar him.

51 He has máde knówn the stréngth of his árm,
and has scáttered the próud in their concéit of héart.
52 He has cást down the míghty from their thrónes
and has exálted thóse who are lówly.
53 He has fílled the húngry with good thíngs,
and has sént the rích away émpty.

54 He has hélped his sérvant Ísrael,
míndful of his mércy,
55 even as he prómised to our fáthers,
to Ábraham and his descéndants foréver.
