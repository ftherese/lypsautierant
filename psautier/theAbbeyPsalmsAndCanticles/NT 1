46 My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
48 for he has looked upon his handmaid in her lowliness;
for behold, from this day forward,
all generations will call me blessed.

49 For the Almighty has done great things for me,
and holy is his name.
50 His mercy is from age to age
for those who fear him.

51 He has made known the strength of his arm,
and has scattered the proud in their conceit of heart.
52 He has cast down the mighty from their thrones
and has exalted those who are lowly.
53 He has filled the hungry with good things,
and has sent the rich away empty.

54 He has helped his servant Israel,
mindful of his mercy,
55 even as he promised to our fathers,
to Abraham and his descendants forever.
