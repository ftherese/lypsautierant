1 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
upon them a light has shone forth.

2 You have made great the nation;
you have increased the joy.
They rejoice before you
as with joy at the harvest,
as people revel when dividing the spoils.

3 For the yoke of his burden,
and the pole across his shoulders,
the rod of his oppressor, you have shattered
as on the day of Midian.

4 For every boot of a trampling warrior,
and every garment rolled in blood
will be burned as fuel for fire.

5 For to us a child is born,
a son is given to us;
authority will be upon his shoulders;
and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor,
Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

6 His authority will continue to increase
and there shall be everlasting peace
upon the throne of David and his kingdom.
And he will uphold it with justice and right
from this time forth and forever.
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.
