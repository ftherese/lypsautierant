1 The péople who wálked in dárkness have seen a gréat líght;
those who dwélt in a lánd of deep dárkness,
upon thém a líght has shone fórth.

2 Yóu have made gréat the nátion;
you have incréased the jóy.
They rejóice befóre you
as with jóy at the hárvest,
as péople rével when divíding the spóils.

3 For the yóke of his búrden,
and the póle acróss his shóulders,
the ród of his oppréssor, you have sháttered
as on the dáy of Mídian.

4 For every bóot of a trámpling wárrior,
and every gárment rólled in blóod
will be búrned as fúel for fíre.

5 For to ús a chíld is bórn,
a són is gíven to us;
authórity will be upón his shóulders;
and his náme will be called Wónderful Cóunselor,
Mighty Gód, Everlasting Fáther, Prínce of Péace.

6 His authórity will contínue to incréase
and there shall be éverlásting péace
upon the thróne of Dávid and his kíngdom.
And hé will uphóld it with jústice and ríght
from thís time fórth and foréver.
The zéal of the Lórd of hósts will dó this.
