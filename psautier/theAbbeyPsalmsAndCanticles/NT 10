11:17 We give you thánks, O Lórd, Almighty Gód,
yóu who áre and who wére.
For yóu have assúmed your gréat pówer
and yóu have begún your réign.

18 The nations ráged, but your wráth has cóme,
and the tíme for the déad to be júdged,
and to rewárd your sérvants the próphets
and the hóly ones and thóse who féar your náme,
the smáll and the gréat alíke.

12:10 Nów have cóme the salvátion
and the pówer and the kíngdom of our Gód,
and the authórity of his Anóinted One,
for the accúser of our bréthren is cast dówn
who accúsed them before our Gód dáy and níght.

11 They cónquered him by the blóod of the Lámb,
and by the wórd of their wítness;
lóve for their lífe did not detér them from déath.
12 Thérefore, rejóice, O héavens,
and yóu who dwéll thereín.
