11:17 We give you thanks, O Lord, Almighty God,
you who are and who were.
For you have assumed your great power
and you have begun your reign.

18 The nations raged, but your wrath has come,
and the time for the dead to be judged,
and to reward your servants the prophets
and the holy ones and those who fear your name,
the small and the great alike.

12:10 Now have come the salvation
and the power and the kingdom of our God,
and the authority of his Anointed One,
for the accuser of our brethren is cast down
who accused them before our God day and night.

11 They conquered him by the blood of the Lamb,
and by the word of their witness;
love for their life did not deter them from death.
12 Therefore, rejoice, O heavens,
and you who dwell therein.
