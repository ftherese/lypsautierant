1b Blessed be God, who lives forever,
and blessed be his kingdom,
2 for he punishes but also shows mercy.

He leads down to the depths of Hades,
and brings up from ruin by his majesty;
and no one can escape his hand.

3 Children of Israel, confess him before the nations,
for he has scattered you among them,
4 and even there has shown you his greatness.

Extol him, then, before every living being,
for he is our Lord and our Father,
he is our God forever.

5 He will punish you for your iniquities,
but on all of you he will have mercy,
he will gather you from all the nations •
wherever you have been scattered.

6 When you turn back to him
with all your heart and all your soul
to do what is true before him,
then he will turn back to you
and no longer hide his face from you.

Now, then, see what he has done for you,
and with full voice, give him your thanks.
Bless the Lord of righteousness,
and exalt the King of the ages.

In the land of my exile I give him thanks,
and show his power and grandeur to a nation of sinners.
Turn back, you sinners, and do what is right before him.
Who knows, he may favor you and show you mercy?

7 To the King of heaven I speak joyfully,
my soul rejoices all the days of my life.

8 Bless the Lord, all you chosen ones;
and all, give praise to his grandeur.
Take up days of rejoicing and confess him.
