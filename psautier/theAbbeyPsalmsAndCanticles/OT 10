1b Blessed be Gód, who líves foréver,
and bléssed be his kíngdom,
2 for he púnishes but álso shows mércy.

He leads dówn to the dépths of Hádes,
and brings úp from rúin by his májesty;
and nó one can escápe his hánd.

3 Children of Ísrael, conféss him before the nátions,
for he has scáttered you amóng them,
4 and even thére has shówn you his gréatness.

Extól him, then, before every líving béing,
for he is our Lórd and our Fáther,
he is our Gód foréver.

5 He will púnish you for your iníquities,
but on áll of you he will have mércy,
he will gáther you from áll the nátions •
wheréver you have been scáttered.

6 Whén you turn báck to him
with áll your héart and áll your sóul
to dó what is trúe before him,
thén he will turn báck to yóu
and nó longer híde his fáce from you.

Nów, then, sée what he has dóne for you,
and with fúll vóice, give him your thánks.
Bléss the Lórd of ríghteousness,
and exált the Kíng of the áges.

In the lánd of my éxile I give him thánks,
and show his pówer and grándeur to a nátion of sínners.
Turn báck, you sínners, and do what is ríght before him.
Who knóws, he may fávor you and show you mércy?

7 To the Kíng of héaven I speak jóyfully,
my soul rejóices all the dáys of my lífe.

8 Bléss the Lórd, all you chósen ones;
and áll, give práise to his grándeur.
Take up dáys of rejóicing and conféss him.
