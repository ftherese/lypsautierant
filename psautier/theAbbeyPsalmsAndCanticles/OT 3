8 At the blást of your ánger, the wáters gáthered,'
the wáves stood úp like a wáll;
the deeps congéaled in the héart of the séa.

9 The fóe said, "I will pursúe, will overtáke;
I will divíde the spóil,
my sóul shall have its fíll of them.
I will báre my swórd;
my hánd shall destróy them."

10 You bléw with your bréath, the séa cóvered them;
they sánk like léad in the míghty wáters.
12 You stretched óut your ríght hand,
the éarth swállowed them.

13 In your faithful lóve you guíded the péople you redéemed.
In your stréngth you léd them to your holy dwélling.
17 You will bríng them ín and plánt them
upon the móunt of your inhéritance.
