8 At the blast of your anger, the waters gathered,'
the waves stood up like a wall;
the deeps congealed in the heart of the sea.

9 The foe said, "I will pursue, will overtake;
I will divide the spoil,
my soul shall have its fill of them.
I will bare my sword;
my hand shall destroy them."

10 You blew with your breath, the sea covered them;
they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
12 You stretched out your right hand,
the earth swallowed them.

13 In your faithful love you guided the people you redeemed.
In your strength you led them to your holy dwelling.
17 You will bring them in and plant them
upon the mount of your inheritance.
