1 Give éar, O héavens, and I will spéak;
O éarth, hear the wórds of my móuth.
2 May my téaching soak ín like the ráin,
my díscourse spréad like the déw,
as gentle ráin on fresh gráss,
as shówers on a fíeld.

3 For the náme of the Lórd I will invóke;
acknówledge the gréatness of our Gód!
4 The Róck, how pérfect his déeds,
for áll his wáys are júst;
a fáithful Gód without decéit:
he is júst and upríght.

5 Yet his chíldren have sínned and are corrúpt,
a depráved and pervérse generátion.
6 Is thís how you repáy the Lórd,
O péople, fóolish and unwíse?
Is not hé your Fáther who creáted you,
who fórmed you and estáblished you?

7 Remémber the dáys of óld,
recall the yéars of pást generátions;
ask your fáther, and he will infórm you,
your élders, and they will téll you:

8 When the Most Hígh allótted the nátions,
when he appórtioned the chíldren of Ádam,
he estáblished the bóundaries of the péople
by the númber of the chíldren of Ísrael.
9 For the pórtion of the Lórd is his péople;
Jácob is the lót of his inhéritance.

10 He fóund him in a région of the désert,
in a bárren hówling wáste.
He enwrápped him and cáred for him;
as the ápple of his éye, he guárded him.

11 As an éagle that brings óut her néstlings,
and hóvers over her yóung,
she spreads óut her wíngs, takes them úp,
and béars them alóft on her pínions,
12 so the Lórd alóne led him fórth,
and there was nó foreign gód besíde him.
