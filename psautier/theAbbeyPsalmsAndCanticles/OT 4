1 Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak;
O earth, hear the words of my mouth.
2 May my teaching soak in like the rain,
my discourse spread like the dew,
as gentle rain on fresh grass,
as showers on a field.

3 For the name of the Lord I will invoke;
acknowledge the greatness of our God!
4 The Rock, how perfect his deeds,
for all his ways are just;
a faithful God without deceit:
he is just and upright.

5 Yet his children have sinned and are corrupt,
a depraved and perverse generation.
6 Is this how you repay the Lord,
O people, foolish and unwise?
Is not he your Father who created you,
who formed you and established you?

7 Remember the days of old,
recall the years of past generations;
ask your father, and he will inform you,
your elders, and they will tell you:

8 When the Most High allotted the nations,
when he apportioned the children of Adam,
he established the boundaries of the people
by the number of the children of Israel.
9 For the portion of the Lord is his people;
Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.

10 He found him in a region of the desert,
in a barren howling waste.
He enwrapped him and cared for him;
as the apple of his eye, he guarded him.

11 As an eagle that brings out her nestlings,
and hovers over her young,
she spreads out her wings, takes them up,
and bears them aloft on her pinions,
12 so the Lord alone led him forth,
and there was no foreign god beside him.
