10 I said: In the midst of my days I must depart.
I am consigned to the gates of Sheol
for the rest of my years.

11 I said, I shall not see
the Lord in the land of the living;
no more shall I look on the human race,
on those who inhabit the world.

12 My dwelling is pulled up and removed from me
like a shepherd's tent;
he has rolled up my life like a weaver,
who severs me from the last thread.
From dawn to dusk you bring me to an end.

13 I cry for help until morning.
Like a lion he crushes all my bones.
From dawn to dusk you bring me to an end.

14 Like a young swallow I murmur;
like a dove I moan.
My eyes grow weary gazing heavenward.
17 You saved my soul from the pit of destruction,
for you have cast behind your back all my sins.

18 For Sheol cannot give you thanks
nor can death give you praise;
nor can those who descend into the pit
hope any longer in your faithfulness.

19 The living, the living give you thanks
as I do this day.
Parents make known to their children your faithfulness.

20 The Lord is here to save me,
and we will sing to the sound of instruments,
all the days of our lives
in the house of the Lord.
