14:20 Blessed the man who waits upon wisdom,
and ponders her justice,
and reflects upon the ways of God.

15:3 She will feed him with the bread of understanding,
with the water of learning to drink,

4 He will rest on her and not fall,
trust in her and not be shamed;

5a She will exalt him above his companions,
6b and he will inherit an everlasting name.
