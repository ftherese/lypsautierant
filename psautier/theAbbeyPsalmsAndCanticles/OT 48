7 Blessed the man who trusts in the Lord,
whose trust is the Lord.

8 He is like a tree planted beside the water,
sending out its roots to the stream.

He shall not fear when heat comes,
and his leaves shall stay green;
in the year of drought not fearful,
for he does not cease to bear fruit.
