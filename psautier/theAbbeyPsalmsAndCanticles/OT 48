7 Bléssed the man who trústs in the Lórd,
whose trúst is the Lórd.

8 Hé is like a trée plánted beside the wáter,
sending óut its róots to the stréam.

Hé shall not féar when héat comes,
and his léaves shall stay gréen;
in the yéar of dróught not féarful,
for hé does not céase to bear frúit.
