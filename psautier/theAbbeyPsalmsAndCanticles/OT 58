8 The Lord says: O wait for me,
for the day when I arise as accuser,
for my decision is to gather the nations,
to assemble the kingdoms,

To pour out on them my fury,
all of my blazing anger.
For in the fire of my jealous wrath
the whole of the earth will be consumed.

9 Yes, then I will change the speech of peoples
and it will be purified,
that all may call upon the name of the Lord
and serve him together, shoulder to shoulder.

10 From beyond the Ethiopian rivers,
my worshippers, the daughter of my exiles:
they shall bring my offering.

11 On that day, you shall not be put to shame
for all your rebellious deeds against me;
for then I will remove from your midst
your proud ones who exult;
and you shall no longer be haughty
on my holy mountain.

12 But I will leave in your midst
a people humble and lowly;
they will seek refuge in the name of the Lord,
13 the remnant of Israel.

They shall do nothing wrong
and speak no falsehood,
nor shall there be a deceitful tongue
found in their mouths.
They shall pasture and lie down
with none to make them fearful.
