18 You neglécted the Róck that begót you,
vou forgót the Gód who gave you bírth.
19 The Lord obsérved it and was jéalous;
he spúrned his sóns and dáughters.

20 And he sáid, "I will híde my fáce from them;
I will sée how their énd will fáre.
For Ihéy are a rebéllious ráce,
chíldren with no fáithfulness in them."

21 "They stírred me to jéalousy with what is no-gód;
incíted me with their ídols.
I will aróuse their jéalousy who are no-péople;
I will provóke them with a nátion of fóols."
