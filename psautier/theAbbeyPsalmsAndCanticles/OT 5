18 You neglected the Rock that begot you,
vou forgot the God who gave you birth.
19 The Lord observed it and was jealous;
he spurned his sons and daughters.

20 And he said, "I will hide my face from them;
I will see how their end will fare.
For Ihey are a rebellious race,
children with no faithfulness in them."

21 "They stirred me to jealousy with what is no-god;
incited me with their idols.
I will arouse their jealousy who are no-people;
I will provoke them with a nation of fools."
