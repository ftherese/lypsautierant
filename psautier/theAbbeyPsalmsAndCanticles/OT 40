7 Thus says the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel
who is his Holy One,
to the one who is despised,
the one abhorred by the nations,
the slave of rulers:

Kings shall see and arise;
nobles shall prostrate themselves
because of the Lord, who is faithful,
the Holy One of Israel, who chose you.

8 Thus says the Lord,
In a time of favor, I have answered you,
on a day of salvation, I have helped you.

I have kept you and formed you
as a covenant of the people,
to restore the land,
to inherit the ruined heritages,

9 Saying to prisoners, "Come forth,"
and to those who are in darkness, "Show yourselves."
They will pasture along the ways,
every bare height shall be their pasture.

10 They shall neither hunger nor thirst,
hot wind or sun shall not smite them;
for he who pities them shall lead them
and guide them to springs of water.

11 And I will make all my mountains a road,
and my highways will be raised up.

12 Behold, these shall come from afar,
and behold, these from the north and the west,
and these from the land of Syene.

13 Sing for joy, O heavens, and exult, O earth!
Break forth into song, O mountains!
For the Lord has comforted his people,
and shows pity to his afflicted ones.
