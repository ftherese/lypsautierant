7 Thús says the Lórd, the Redéemer of Ísrael
who is his Hóly One,
to the óne who is despísed,
the one abhórred by the nátions,
the sláve of rúlers:

Kíngs shall sée and aríse;
nóbles shall próstrate themselves
because of the Lórd, who is fáithful,
the Hóly One of Ísrael, who chóse you.

8 Thús says the Lórd,
In a time of fávor, I have ánswered you,
on a dáy of salvátion, I have hélped you.

I have képt you and fórmed you
as a cóvenant of the péople,
to restóre the lánd,
to inhérit the rúined héritages,

9 Saying to prísoners, "Come fórth,"
and to thóse who are in dárkness, "Shów yourselves."
They will pásture along the wáys,
every bare héight shall be their pásture.

10 They shall neither húnger nor thírst,
hot wínd or sún shall not smíte them;
for he who píties them shall léad them
and guíde them to spríngs of wáter.

11 And I will make áll my móuntains a róad,
and my híghways will be raised úp.

12 Behóld, these shall cóme from afár,
and behóld, thése from the nórth and the wést,
and thése from the lánd of Syéne.

13 Síng for jóy, O héavens, and exúlt, O éarth!
Break fórth into sóng, O móuntains!
For the Lórd has cómforted his péople,
and shows píty to his afflícted ones.
