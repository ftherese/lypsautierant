1 O Lórd, have mércy on ús,
for yóu we have wáited;
bé our árm in the mórning,
and our salvátion in tíme of distréss.

3 At the sóund of túmult, péoples fléd;
at your rísing, nátions scáttered.

4 Your préy shall be gáthered as the cáterpillar gáthers,
as lócusts léap, so he léaps upon it.

5 The Lórd is exálted, for he dwélls on hígh;
he will fíll Zíon with jústice and ríght.
6 Hé will be the stabílity for your tímes;
wísdom and knówledge are the ríches of salvátion;
her tréasure is the féar of the Lórd.

7 Behóld, the váliant lamént in the stréets;
the méssengers of péace weep bítterly.
8 Híghways are désolate, trávelers have quít the páth;
he has bróken the cóvenant, despísed the wítnesses;
there is nó regárd for ányone.

9 The lánd is móurning, píning awáy;
Lébanon wíthers with sháme,
Sháron has becóme like a wásteland.
Báshan and Cármel are stripped báre.

10 "Nów will I aríse," says the Lórd,
"nów will I be exálted, now be lifted úp."
