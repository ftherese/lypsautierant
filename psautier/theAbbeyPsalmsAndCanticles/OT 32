1 O Lord, have mercy on us,
for you we have waited;
be our arm in the morning,
and our salvation in time of distress.

3 At the sound of tumult, peoples fled;
at your rising, nations scattered.

4 Your prey shall be gathered as the caterpillar gathers,
as locusts leap, so he leaps upon it.

5 The Lord is exalted, for he dwells on high;
he will fill Zion with justice and right.
6 He will be the stability for your times;
wisdom and knowledge are the riches of salvation;
her treasure is the fear of the Lord.

7 Behold, the valiant lament in the streets;
the messengers of peace weep bitterly.
8 Highways are desolate, travelers have quit the path;
he has broken the covenant, despised the witnesses;
there is no regard for anyone.

9 The land is mourning, pining away;
Lebanon withers with shame,
Sharon has become like a wasteland.
Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.

10 "Now will I arise," says the Lord,
"now will I be exalted, now be lifted up."
