2 O Lord, I have heard of your fame;
I am in awe, O Lord, of your work.
In the midst of the years, renew it.
In the midst of the years, make it known;
in your anger, remember compassion.

3 God is coming from Teman,
the Holy One from Mount Paran.
His glory covers the heavens;
and the earth is full of his praise.

4 His splendor is as the light:
rays come forth from his hand;
and there lies hidden his power.

13 You have come forth to save your people,
to save the one you have anointed.
15 You tread the sea with your steeds,
churning up the mighty waters.

16 I hear and quake to my inner depths;
my lips quiver at the sound.
Decay invades my bones;
and my steps beneath me tremble.
I await the day of distress,
for the people who come to attack us.

17 Though the fig tree fails to blossom,
or the vine to yield its fruit;
though the crop of the olive fails,
and the fields produce no grain;
though the flock is removed from the fold,
and there are no cattle in the stalls;

18 Yet will I rejoice in the Lord,
and rejoice in the God of my salvation.
19 The Lord, my Lord, is my strength;
he makes my feet like those of the deer,
and makes me tread upon the heights.
