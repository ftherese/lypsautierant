2 O Lórd, I have héard of your fáme;
Í am in áwe, O Lórd, of your wórk.
In the mídst of the yéars, renéw it.
In the mídst of the yéars, máke it knówn;
in your ánger, remémber compássion.

3 Gód is cóming from Téman,
the Hóly One from Móunt Páran.
His glóry cóvers the héavens;
and the éarth is fúll of his práise.

4 His spléndor is ás the líght:
ráys come fórth from his hánd;
and thére lies hídden his pówer.

13 Yóu have come fórth to sáve your péople,
to sáve the óne you have anóinted.
15 You tréad the séa with your stéeds,
chúrning up the míghty wáters.

16 I héar and quáke to my ínner dépths;
my líps quíver at the sóund.
Decáy invádes my bónes;
and my stéps benéath me trémble.
I awáit the dáy of distréss,
for the péople who cóme to attáck us.

17 Though the fíg tree fáils to blóssom,
or the víne to yíeld its frúit;
though the cróp of the ólive fáils,
and the fíelds prodúce no gráin;
though the flóck is remóved from the fóld,
and thére are no cáttle in the stálls;

18 Yét will I rejóice in the Lórd,
and rejóice in the Gód of my salvátion.
19 The Lórd, my Lórd, is my stréngth;
he makes my féet like thóse of the déer,
and mákes me tréad upon the héights.
