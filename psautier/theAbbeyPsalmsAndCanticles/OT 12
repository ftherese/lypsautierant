8 Bless the Lord, all you chosen ones;
and all, give praise to his grandeur.
Take up days of rejoicing and confess him.

9 O Jerusalem, holy city,
for the works of your hands he will punish you.

10 Give thanks to the Lord with good works,
and bless the King of the ages
so that his tent may be rebuilt in you with joy.

And may he gladden all captives within you;
and may he love all the anguished within you
for all generations, forever.

11 A brilliant light will shine to all the ends of the earth;
many nations will come to you from afar,
and from all the earth's ends to your holy name,
bearing their gifts in their hands for the King of heaven.
Generation after generation
will give joyful praise in you,
and the name of the chosen one will be forever.

13 Then you will rejoice and exult
over the children of the righteous,
for they will all be gathered in
and will bless the Lord of the ages.

14 Blessed are those who love you,
and blessed those who rejoice in your fruitful peace.

15 O my soul, bless the Lord, the great King,
16 for Jerusalem shall be built as a city,
his house from age to age.
