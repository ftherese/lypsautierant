8 Bléss the Lórd, all you chósen ones;
and áll, give práise to his grándeur.
Take up dáys of rejóicing and conféss him.

9 O Jerúsalem, holy cíty,
for the wórks of your hánds he will púnish you.

10 Give thánks to the Lórd with góod wórks,
and bléss the Kíng of the áges
so that his tént may be rebúilt in you with jóy.

And may he gládden all cáptives within yóu;
and may he lóve all the angúished withín you
for áll generátions, foréver.

11 A brilliant líght will shíne to all the énds of the éarth;
many nátions will cóme to you from afár,
and from all the éarth's énds to your holy náme,
bearing their gífts in their hánds for the Kíng of héaven.
Generátion after generátion
will give jóyful práise in you,
and the náme of the chósen one will be foréver.

13 Thén you will rejóice and exúlt
over the chíldren of the ríghteous,
for they will áll be gathered ín
and will bléss the Lórd of the áges.

14 Bléssed are thóse who lóve you,
and bléssed those who rejóice in your frúitful péace.

15 O my sóul, bless the Lórd, the great Kíng,
16 for Jerúsalem shall be búilt as a cíty,
his hóuse from áge to áge.
