1 Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us;
behold, and see our disgrace!

2 Our heritage has passed to foreigners,
our homes to strangers.

3 We have become orphans, fatherless,
our mothers are like widows.

4 The water we drink we must buy,
obtain kindling at a price.

5 On our necks is the yoke of our captors;
we are weary, we are given no rest.
6 We held out a hand to Egypt,
to Assyria for our fill of bread.

7 Our parents who sinned are no more,
yet we bear their guilt.

15 Gone is the joy of our hearts;
our dancing has turned to mourning:

16 The crown has fallen from our head;
woe to us who have sinned.

17 Our heart is sick because of this;
so too, our eyes are dimmed.

19 You, O Lord, are enthroned forever;
your throne endures from age to age.

20 Why have you forgotten us forever,
forsaken us for length of days.

21 Turn us back, O Lord, to yourself
that we may be restored:
give us back the days of old.
