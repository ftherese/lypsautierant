1 Remémber, O Lórd, what has befállen us;
behóld, and sée our disgráce!

2 Our héritage has pássed to fóreigners,
our hómes to strángers.

3 Wé have become órphans, fátherless,
our móthers are like wídows.

4 The wáter we drínk we must búy,
obtáin kíndling at a príce.

5 On our nécks is the yóke of our cáptors;
we are wéary, we are gíven no rést.
6 We héld out a hánd to Égypt,
to Assýria for our fíll of bréad.

7 Our párents who sínned are nó móre,
yet we béar their guílt.

15 Góne is the jóy of our héarts;
our dáncing has túrned to móurning:

16 The crówn has fállen from our héad;
wóe to ús who have sínned.

17 Our héart is síck because of this;
só tóo, our éyes are dímmed.

19 Yóu, O Lórd, are enthróned foréver;
your thróne endúres from áge to áge.

20 Whý have you forgótten us foréver,
forsáken us for léngth of dáys.

21 Turn us báck, O Lórd, to yoursélf
that wé may be restóred:
give us báck the dáys of óld.
