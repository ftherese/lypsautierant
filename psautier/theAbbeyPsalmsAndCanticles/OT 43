4 No more shall you be called "Forsaken,"
nor your land be called "Desolate."
But you shall be called "My Delight is in her,”
and your land "Espoused."
For the Lord delights in you,
and your land shall be espoused.

5 For as a young man marries a virgin
your Builder shall marry you;
and as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride,
so will your God rejoice in you.

6 Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,
I have stationed watchmen;
neither by day nor by night
shall they be silent.

You who are to remind the Lord,
you shall take no rest.
7 And give no rest to him
until he establishes Jerusalem
making her renowned upon the earth.
