NT 2

68 Bléssed be the Lórd Gód of Ísrael:
for he has vísited his péople and redéemed them;
69 he has ráised up for ús a hórn of salvátion
in the Hóuse of Dávid his sérvant,
70 as he spóke through the móuth of his hóly ones,
his próphets from áges pást:

71 To gránt salvátion from our fóes,
and from the hánd of áll who háte us,
72 showing mércy to our fáthers,
remémbering his holy cóvenant,
73 the óath he swóre to Ábraham our fáther;

74 To gránt that, fréed from the hánd of our fóes,
75 we may sérve him without féar
in hóliness and ríghteousness
áll the dáys of our lífe.

76 And yóu, little chíld, will be cálled
the Próphet of the Móst Hígh,
for yóu will gó before the Lórd
to make réady his wáys:
77 to grant knówledge of salvátion to his péople
by the forgíveness of their síns;

78 Through the ténder mércy of our Gód,
the Dáwn from on hígh will vísit us,
79 to shíne on thóse who sit in dárkness,
and thóse in the shádow of déath;
to guíde our féet into the wáy of péace.
