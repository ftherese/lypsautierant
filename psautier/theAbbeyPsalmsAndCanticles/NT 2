68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel:
for he has visited his people and redeemed them;
69 he has raised up for us a horn of salvation
in the House of David his servant,
70 as he spoke through the mouth of his holy ones,
his prophets from ages past:

71 To grant salvation from our foes,
and from the hand of all who hate us,
72 showing mercy to our fathers,
remembering his holy covenant,
73 the oath he swore to Abraham our father;

74 To grant that, freed from the hand of our foes,
75 we may serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness
all the days of our life.

76 And you, little child, will be called
the Prophet of the Most High,
for you will go before the Lord
to make ready his ways:
77 to grant knowledge of salvation to his people
by the forgiveness of their sins;

78 Through the tender mercy of our God,
the Dawn from on high will visit us,
79 to shine on those who sit in darkness,
and those in the shadow of death;
to guide our feet into the way of peace.
