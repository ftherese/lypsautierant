4:11 Wórthy are yóu, O Lórd, our Gód
to receive glóry and hónor and pówer,
for yóu have creáted all thíngs
and by your wíll they cáme to bé and were creáted.

5:9b Wórthy are yóu, O Lórd, to recéive the scróll
and to break ópen its séals,
for yóu were sláin
and with your blóod you have ránsomed for Gód
thóse from every tríbe and tóngue,
and every péople and nátion:

10 And made them a kíngdom and príests for our Gód,
and they shall réign on the eárth.
12b Wórthy is the Lámb that was sláin
to receive pówer and ríches and wísdom,
stréngth and hónor, and glóry and bléssing.
