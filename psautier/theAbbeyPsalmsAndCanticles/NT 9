4:11 Worthy are you, O Lord, our God
to receive glory and honor and power,
for you have created all things
and by your will they came to be and were created.

5:9b Worthy are you, O Lord, to receive the scroll
and to break open its seals,
for you were slain
and with your blood you have ransomed for God
those from every tribe and tongue,
and every people and nation:

10 And made them a kingdom and priests for our God,
and they shall reign on the earth.
12b Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
to receive power and riches and wisdom,
strength and honor, and glory and blessing.
