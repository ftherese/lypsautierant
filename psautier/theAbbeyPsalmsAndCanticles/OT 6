26 I sáid, "I will redúce them to nóthing,
and blot óut a mémory of them from the húman ráce.
27 Yet I féared a góading by the énemy
that their fóes might nót understánd

And decláre, 'Our hánd has tríumphed;
it is nót the Lórd who accómplished all this.’
28 For they are a nátion vóid of good cóunsel;
and there is nó discérnment in them."

30 "How could one mán deféat a thóusand,
or twó put ten thóusand to flíght
unless their Róck had betráyed them,
that the Lórd had gíven them úp?"

35 The dáy of their rúin is at hánd;
and their dóom befálls them swíftly.
36 Indéed, the Lórd will víndicate his péople;
and hé will have cómpassion on his sérvants.
