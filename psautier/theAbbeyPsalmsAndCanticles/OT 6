26 I said, "I will reduce them to nothing,
and blot out a memory of them from the human race.
27 Yet I feared a goading by the enemy
that their foes might not understand

And declare, 'Our hand has triumphed;
it is not the Lord who accomplished all this.’
28 For they are a nation void of good counsel;
and there is no discernment in them."

30 "How could one man defeat a thousand,
or two put ten thousand to flight
unless their Rock had betrayed them,
that the Lord had given them up?"

35 The day of their ruin is at hand;
and their doom befalls them swiftly.
36 Indeed, the Lord will vindicate his people;
and he will have compassion on his servants.
