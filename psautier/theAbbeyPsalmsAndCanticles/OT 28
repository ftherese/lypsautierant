2 It will háppen in the látter dáys
that the móuntain of the hóuse of the Lórd
will be estáblished as the híghest móuntain
and will be ráised above the hílls.

Thén all the nátions shall stréam toward it;
3 and mány péoples shall cóme and sáy,
"Cóme, let us go úp to the móuntain of the Lórd,
to the hóuse of the Gód of Jácob,
that hé may instrúct us in his wáys,
and wé may wálk in his páths."

For out of Zíon shall go fórth instrúction,
and the wórd of the Lórd from Jerúsalem.
4 And he will júdge between nátions,
and decíde térms for many péoples.

And they shall béat their swórds into plówshares,
and their spéars into prúning hooks.
Nátion shall not líft up swórd against nátion,
and they shall néver agáin learn wár.

5 O hóuse of Jácob, cóme,
let us wálk in the líght of the Lórd.
