2 It will happen in the latter days
that the mountain of the house of the Lord
will be established as the highest mountain
and will be raised above the hills.

Then all the nations shall stream toward it;
3 and many peoples shall come and say,
"Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the house of the God of Jacob,
that he may instruct us in his ways,
and we may walk in his paths."

For out of Zion shall go forth instruction,
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
4 And he will judge between nations,
and decide terms for many peoples.

And they shall beat their swords into plowshares,
and their spears into pruning hooks.
Nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
and they shall never again learn war.

5 O house of Jacob, come,
let us walk in the light of the Lord.
