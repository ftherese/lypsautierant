10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, exult in her,
all you who love her.
Rejoice with her in joy,
all who were mourning over her,

11 So that you may nurse and be satisfied
from her consoling breast,
so that you may drink deeply and delight
in the abundance of her glory.

12 For thus says the Lord: "Behold, I will extend to her
peace like a river, and the glory of the nations
like a stream in full flood.
You will be suckled, carried on the hip,
and gently bounced on her knees.

13 As a mother comforts her son,
so I will comfort you,
and in Jerusalem you shall find comfort.

14 You shall see and your heart shall rejoice;
your limbs shall flourish like grass."
