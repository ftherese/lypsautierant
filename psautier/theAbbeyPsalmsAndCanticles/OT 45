10 Rejóice with Jerúsalem, exúlt in her,
all yóu who lóve her.
Rejóice with her in jóy,
áll who were móurning over her,

11 So that you may núrse and be sátisfied
from her consóling bréast,
so that you may drínk déeply and délight
in the abúndance of her glóry.

12 For thús says the Lórd: "Behóld, I will exténd to her
péace like a ríver, and the glóry of the nátions
like a stréam in fúll flóod.
You will be súckled, cárried on the híp,
and gently bóunced on her knées.

13 As a móther cómforts her són,
so Í will comfort yóu,
and in Jerúsalem you shall find cómfort.

14 You shall sée and your héart shall rejóice;
your límbs shall flóurish like gráss."
