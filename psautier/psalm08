Psalm 8(8) Domine, Dominus noster

2 How great is your name, O Lord our God,
through all the earth!

Your majesty is praised above the heavens;
3 on the lips of children and of babes
you have found praise to foil your enemy,
to silence the foe and the rebel.

4 When I see the heavens, the work of your hands,
the moon and the stars which you arranged,
5 what is man that you should keep him in mind,
mortal man that you care for him?

6 Yet you have made him little less than a god;
with glory and honor you crowned him,
7 gave him power over the works of your hands,
put all things under his feet.

8 All of them, sheep and cattle,
yes, even the savage beasts,
9 birds of the air, and fish
that make their way through the waters.

10 How great is your name, O Lord our God
through all the earth!
