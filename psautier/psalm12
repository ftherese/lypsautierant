Psalm 12(11) Salva me fac

2 Help, O Lord, for good men have vanished;
truth has gone from the sons of men.
3 Falsehood they speak one to another,
with lying lips, with a false heart.

4 May the Lord destroy all lying lips,
the tongue that speaks high-sounding words,
5 those who say: "Our tongue is our strength;
our lips are our own, who is our master?"

6 "For the poor who are oppressed and the needy who groan
I myself will arise," says the Lord,
"I will grant them the salvation for which they thirst."

7 The words of the Lord are words without alloy,
silver from the furnace, seven times refined.

8 It is you, O Lord, who will take us in your care
and protect us for ever from this generation.
9 See how the wicked prowl on every side,
while the worthless are prized highly by the sons of men.
