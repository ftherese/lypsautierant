Psalm 13(12) Usquequo, Domine?

2 How long, O Lord, will you forget me?
How long will you hide your face?
3 How long must I bear grief in my soul,
this sorrow in my heart day and night?
How long shall my enemy prevail?

4 Look at me, answer me, Lord my God!
Give light to my eyes lest I fall asleep in death,
5 lest my enemy say: "I have overcome him";
lest my foes rejoice to see my fall.

6 As for me, I trust in your merciful love.
Let my heart rejoice in your saving help:
7 Let me sing to the Lord for his goodness to me,
singing psalms to the name of the Lord, the Most High.
