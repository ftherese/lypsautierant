Psalm 36(35) Dixit injustus

2 Sin speaks to the sinner
in the depths of his heart.
There is no fear of God
before his eyes.

3 He so flatters himself in his mind
that he knows not his guilt.
4 In his mouth are mischief and deceit.
All wisdom is gone.

5 He plots the defeat of goodness
as he lies on his bed.
He has set his foot on evil ways,
he clings to what is evil.

6 Your love, Lord, reaches to heaven;
your truth to the skies.
7 Your justice is like God's mountain,
your judgments like the deep.

To both man and beast you give protection.
/.8 O Lord, how precious is your love.
My God, the sons of men
find refuge in the shelter of your wings.

9 They feast on the riches of your house;
they drink from the stream of your delight.
10 In you is the source of life
and in your light we see light.

11 Keep on loving those who know you,
doing justice for upright hearts.
12 Let the foot of the proud not crush me
nor the hand of the wicked cast me out.

13 See how the evildoers fall!
Flung down, they shall never arise.
