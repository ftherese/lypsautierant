Psalm 24(23) Domini est terra

1 The Lord's is the earth and its fullness,
the world and all its peoples.
2 It is he who set it on the seas;
on the waters he made it firm.

3 Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?
Who shall stand in his holy place?
4 The man with clean hands and pure heart,
who desires not worthless things,
(who have not sworn so as to deceive their neighbor.)

5 He shall receive blessings from the Lord
and reward from the God who saves him .
6 Such are the men who seek him,
seek the face of the God of Jacob.

7 O gates, lift high your heads;
grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!

8 Who is the king of glory?
The Lord, the mighty, the valiant,
the Lord, the valiant in war.

9 O gates, lift high your heads;
grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!

10 Who is he, the king of glory?
He, the Lord of armies,
he is the king of glory.
