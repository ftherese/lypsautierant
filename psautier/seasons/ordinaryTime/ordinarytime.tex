\begin{cverse}
God creator of light,\\
You who have illuminated the day,\\
You have given life to the world\\
In giving it a new light.\\!

You who have woven morning to evening\\
And have given the day its name,\\
When darkness threatens us,\\
Hear the sound of our cry.\\!

May our spirit, weighed down by sin,\\
Never wander far from life,\\
Constantly drawn toward nothingness,\\
Caught in the net of its errors.\\!

May it knock at Heavenâ€™s gate,\\
And receive eternal life,\\
And we will flee from all stain\\
Purifi ed of every impurity.\\!

Glory to the Father creator of all\\
Glory to the Son who has saved us\\
And glory to the Most Holy Spirit,\\
Forever and ever. Amen.\\!
\end{cverse}

\begin{cverse}
Our King comes in his great glory\\
To delight us with his glorious light;\\
Let us light our lamps and go forth to meet him.\\
Let us rejoice in him as he rejoices in us.\\!

Daylight has dawned upon mankind,\\
The power of darkness is dispelled,\\
From its light breaks the light\\
Th at enlightens our clouded eyes.\\!

He has made his glory rise upon the world,\\
He has shed light on the depths of the abyss.\\
Death is destroyed, darkness is no more,\\
The gates of hell are broken down.\\!

He has enlightened every creature,\\
The dead who lay in the dust have been raised,\\
They give glory to the Almighty Lord,\\
For he has brought them salvation\\!

He has accomplished salvation and has given us life,\\
He has been raised up to his Father,\\
He will come back in his great glory\\
To bring light to the eyes of those who have waited for him.\\!

His day will dawn like lightning,\\
And his saints will go forth to meet him,\\
All those who have prepared themselves in fatigue and sorrow,\\
Holding lighted lamps in their hands.\\!

Glory to You, most loving Father,\\
Glory to you risen Son,\\
And praise to the Spirt of Truth\\
Forever and ever. Amen.\\!

\begin{cverse}
God of all, Immortal, Imperceptible, Invisible\\
You became mortal, to all accessible,\\
Visible in the flesh for all humanity,\\
Resplendent with glory for your faithful people.\\!

He who has believed has seen and contemplated your glory,\\
With him you share the obscurity of this life,\\
Sun that never sets, inextinguishable lamp,\\
You draw us to you, resplendent with light.\\!

According to the flesh, you share our nature,\\
As we have a share in your divinity,\\
For in taking on our human nature,\\
You have given us your Most Holy Spirit.\\!

Together, we form but one family,\\
We your brothers, you with us,\\
You make of each your temple, your dwelling place,\\
In you we abide, in you we find our rest.\\!

Mortal, we have become immortal,\\
Without losing our nature, we become your sons,\\
Resembling you, members of your Body\\
By your grace, we contemplate the Father.\\!

Glory to the Father who has glorified us,\\
Glory to the Son who has saved us,\\
Glory to the Holy Spirit who has made us divine,\\
Forever and ever. Amen.\\!

All powerful Lord, creator of heaven and earth,\\

To You our heart is turned, you our spirit acclaims,\\
Heaven and earth bless you and praise you,\\

We adore you in humility and great joy.\\!

Your death delivers us from all that opposes you,\\
May it free us from hatred and discord,\\

Prepare in our hearts, O Lord,\\
A dwelling for the never-ending Day.\\
Grant that we may see revealed in ourselves\\
The life of the Resurrection.\\!

Your crucifixion, O Lord our Savior,\\
Was the end of your earthly pilgrimage,\\
Grant that we may crucify our spirits\\
That we may live in the Spirit Most Holy.\\!

By your Resurrection, O Jesus,\\
May the spiritual man in us increase,\\
May your mysteries, which we contemplate,\\
Be the mirror wherein we gaze upon you.\\!

Glory to the Father who created us,\\
Glory to the Son who redeemed us,\\
And glory to the Spirit Most Holy,\\
Who gives us joy in his grace. Amen.\\!

\noindent\small{\uppercase{Hymn VII Friday Vespers}}\normalsize\label{ordinaryTime:lastHymn}
\begin{cverse}
We give you thanks, Only Lord,\\
You who probe hearts, merciful Judge,\\
We give you thanks, O Eternal Word,\\
Come down to us, man among men.\\!

Impassible, you deigned to suffer,\\
Giving the condemned your impassability,\\
Your judgment is justice,\\
Your commandment, humility.\\!

You were treated as an enemy of God,\\
Put in chains like a criminal\\
Ridiculed, scorned, abandoned by your friends,\\
You accepted an unjust sentence.\\!

For a word, you were slapped,\\
For your silence, condemned,\\
Crowned with thorns, weighed down by the cross,\\
You were raised up from the earth.\\!

We give you glory, Father, the Giver of Life,\\
Son exalted in glory, source of all our hope,\\
Spirit of God, gift that we adore,\\
Both now and forevermore. Amen.\\!
\end{cverse}
