THURSDAY AFTER TRINITY SUNDAY
CORPUS CHRISTI
SOLEMNITY

FIRST VESPERS
HYMN
God, with hidden majesty, lies in presence here,
I, with deep devotion, my true God revere:
Whom this outward shape and form secretly contains,
Christ in his divinity manhood still retains.

All my other senses cannot now perceive,
But my hearing, taught by faith, always will believe:
I accept whatever God the Son has said:
Those who hear the word of God, by the truth are fed.

God lay stretched upon the cross, only man could die,
Here upon the altar God and man both lie;
This I firmly hold true, this is my belief,
And I seek salvation, like the dying thief.

Wounds that doubting Thomas saw I could never see,
But I still acknowledge you my true God to be;
Grant that I shall always keep strong in faith and trust,
Guided by my Savior, merciful and just.

Blest reminder of the death suffered for mankind,
Sacrament of living bread, health to every mind,
Let my soul approach you, live within your grace,
Let me taste the perfect joys time shall not efface.

SECOND VESPERS
HYMN
I shall praise the Savior's glory,
Of his flesh the mystery sing,
And the blood, all price excelling,
Shed by our immortal King:
God made man for our salvation,
Who from Virgin pure did spring.

Born for us, and for us given,
Born a man like us below,
Christ as man with man residing,
Lived the seed of truth to sow,
Suffered bitter death unflinching,
And immortal love did show.

On the night before he suffered,
Seated with his chosen band,
Jesus, when they all had feasted,
Faithful to the law's command,
Far more precious food provided:
Gave himself with his own hand.

Word made flesh, true bread of heaven
By his word made flesh to be;
From the wine his blood is taken,
Though our senses cannot see;
Faith alone which is unshaken
Shows pure hearts the mystery.

Therefore we, before him falling,
This great sacrament revere;
Ancient forms are now departed,
For new acts of grace are here;
Faith our feeble senses aiding,
Makes the Savior's presence clear.

To the everlasting Father
And his Son who reigns on high,
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from each eternally,
Be all honor, glory, blessing,
Power and endless majesty.
-Pange Lingua by St Thomas Aquinas, 1225-1274

SACRED HEART
SOLEMNITY

FIRST VESPERS
HYMN
Jesus, From your side pierced by the lance,
You let blood and water flow;
You have opened the Gate of life for your elect,
Through this Gate the just will enter.

Such is the door on the side of the ark,
The living enter there to escape the deluge,
Such is the source gushing from Paradise,
It floods all the earth and restores life.

Arise, therefore, you who love Christ,
Be for him like the dove in the hollow of the rock,
Like the swallow never ceasing its spiral,
Like a turtle-dove protecting its young.

Lord, you have redeemed me by your blood,
Reunite me with your elect,
Do not hold my faults against me
But wound me with your charity.

Glory to Christ whose heart was pierced,
Glory to the Father who engenders him,
Glory to the Spirit, the Counselor,
For all eternity. Amen.

ORDINARY TIME



HYMN FOR FIRST VESPERS OF SUNDAY
Now thank we all our God
With heart and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things has done,
In whom his world rejoices;
Who from our mothers' arms
Has blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.

O may this gracious God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts,
And blessed peace to cheer us;
Preserve us in his grace,
And guide us in distress,
And free us form all sin,
Till heaven we possess.

All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son and Spirit blest,
Who reigns in highest heaven;
Eternal, Triune God,
Whom earth and heaven adore;
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be ever more.

HYMN FOR FIRST VESPERS OF SUNDAY
At the name of Jesus
Ev'ry knee shall bow,
Ev'ry tongue confess him
King of glory now;
'Tis the Father's pleasure,
We should call him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the mighty Word.

Humbled for a reason,
To receive a name
From the lips of sinners,
Unto whom he came,
Faithfully he bore it,
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death he passed.

Bore it up triumphant,
With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
To the central height,
To the throne of Godhead,
To the Father's breast;
Filled it with the glory
Of that perfect rest.

In your hearts enthrone him
There, let him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true;
May your voice entreat him
In temptation's hour;
Let his will enfold you
In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again,
With his Father's glory,
O'er the earth to reign;
He is God the Savior,
He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped,
Always blest, adored.
-C. Noel, 1877

HYMN
Our King comes in his great glory
To delight us with his glorious light;
Let us light our lamps and go forth to meet him.
Let us rejoice in him as he rejoices in us.

Daylight has dawned upon mankind,
The power of darkness is dispelled,
From its light breaks the light
That enlightens our clouded eyes.

He has made his glory rise upon the world,
He has shed light on the depths of the abyss.
Death is destroyed, darkness is no more,
The gates of hell are shattered.

He has enlightened every creature,
The dead who lay in the dust have been raised,
They give glory to the Almighty Lord,
For he has brought them salvation.

He has accomplished salvation and has given us life,
He has been raised up to his Father,
He will come back in his great glory
To bring light to the eyes of those who have waited for him.

His day will dawn like lightning,
And his saints will go forth to meet him,
All those who have prepared themselves in fatigue and sorrow,
Holding lighted lamps in their hands.

Glory to You, most loving Father,
Glory to You, risen Son,
And praise to the Spirit of Truth
For ever and ever. Amen.
-Saint Ephrem

HYMN FOR SECOND VESPERS OF SUNDAY
O Christ, you are the light and day
Which drives away the night,
The ever shining Sun of God
And pledge of future light.

As now the ev'ning shadows fall
Please grant us, Lord, we pray,
A quiet night to rest in you
Until the break of day.

Remember us, poor mortal men,
We humbly ask, O Lord,
And may your presence in our souls
Be now our great reward.

HYMN FOR WEEKDAYS
O Father, whose creating hand
Brings harvest from the fruitful land,
Your providence we gladly own,
And bring our hyns before your throne
To praise you for the living bread
On which our lives are daily fed.

O Lord, who in the desert fed
The hungry thousands in their need,
Where want and famine still abound
Let your relieving love be found,
And in your name may we supply
Your hungry children when they cry.

O Spirit, your revealing light
Has led our questing souls aright
Source of our science, you have taught
The marvels human minds have wrought,
So that the barren deserts yield
The bounty by your love revealed.

HYMN FOR WEEKDAYS
Lord Jesus Christ, abide with us,
Now that the sun has run its course;
Let hope not be obscured by night,
But may faith's darkness be as light.

Lord Jesus Christ, grant us your peace,
And when the trials of earth shall cease,
Grant us the morning light of grace,
The radiant splendor of your face.

Immortal, Holy, Threefold Light,
Yours be the kingdom, pow'r, and might;
All glory be eternally
To you, life-giving Trinity!

HYMN
God, whose almighty word
Chaos and darkness heard
And took their flight:
Hear us, we humbly pray,
And where the Gospel day
Sheds not its glorious ray
Let there be light.

Savior, who came to bring
On your redeeming wing
Healing and sight--
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly bling--
O now to all mankind
Let there be light.

Spirit of truth and love,
Life-giving holy dove,
Speed on your flight;
Move on the water's face,
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth's darkest place
Let there be light.

Holy and blessed Three,
Glorious Trinity,
Wisdom, Love, Might,
Boundless as ocean-tide
Rolling in fullest pride,
Through the world, far and wide
Let there be light.
-John Marriott, 1780-1825

HYMN FOR VESPERS ON FRIDAY
When, in his own image
God created man,
He included freedom
In creation's plan.
For he loved us even
From before our birth;
By his grace he made us
Freemen of this earth.

God to man entrusted
Life as gift and aim.
Sin became our prison,
Turning hope to shame.
Man against his brother
Lifted hand and sword,
And the Father's pleading
Went unseen, unheard.

Then in time, our maker
Chose to intervene,
Set his love in person
In the human scene.
Jesus broke the circle
Of repeated sin,
So that man's devotion
Newly might begin.

Choose we now in freedom
Where we should belong.
Let us turn to Jesus,
Let our choice be strong.
May the great obedience
Which in Christ we see
Perfect all our service
Then we shall be free!
