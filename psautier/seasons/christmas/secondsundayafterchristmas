HYMN and READING from the Nativity p. ?

FIRST VESPERS

READING:    1 Jn 5:20     We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us discernment to know the one who is true. And we are in the one who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.

MAGNIFICAT:	By the power of the Holy Spirit the Virgin Mary has conceived a child; she carries in her womb this mystery which she cannot comprehend.

INVITATORY
(If the Epiphany is celebrated on January 6th)
Christ has been born for us; come, let us adore him.

BENEDICTUS:	The Virgin believed in the Lord's promise: as a virgin she gave birth to the Word made man, and yet she remained a virgin. Let us praise her and say: Blessed are you among women.

PRAYER:	Almighty ever-living God, splendor of faithful souls, graciously be pleased to fill the world with you glory, and show yourself to all people by the radiance of your light. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
