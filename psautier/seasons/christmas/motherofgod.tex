\begin{verse}
Rejoice, O holy Mother,\\
You who gave birth to the King of kings,\\
Who throughout the ages holds in His hands\\
The heavens, the earth, and the entire universe.\\!

The divine king to whom the boundless empire\\
Belongs for the duration of time\\
Gave to your blessed womb\\
The joys of a Mother and the honor of a Virgin.\\!

No woman is your equal,\\
Either in ages past or in future years,\\
You who alone are full of grace\\
Who found favor with Christ our Savior.\\!

O Virgin, you were deemed worthy\\
To give birth to the God who triumphs over evil,\\
The enemy trembles for he has seen mercy,\\
The wolf flees for the Lamb is victorious.\\!

Let us give glory to the Everlasting Father,\\
To his Son who was birn of a Virgin,\\
To the Spirit who overshadowed her,\\
Forever and ever. Amen.\\!
\end{verse}
