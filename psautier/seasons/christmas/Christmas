Hymn I
Christe, redemptor omnium,
Ex Patre, Patris Unice,
Solus ante principium
Natus ineffabiliter.

Tu lumen, tu splendor Patris,
Tu spes perennis omnium,
Intende quas fundunt preces
Tui per orbem servuli.

Salutis auctor, recole
Quod nostri quondam corporis,
Ex illibata Virgine
Nascendo, formam sumpseris.

Hic praesens testatur dies,
Currens per anni circulum,
Quod solus a sede Patris
Mundi salus adveneris;

Hunc caelum, terra, hunc mare,
Hunc omne quod in eis est,
Auctorem adventus tui
Ludat exsultans cantico.

Nos quoque, qui sancto tuo
Redempti sumus sanguine,
Ob diem natalis tui
Hymnum novum concinimus

Jesus, tibi sit gloria,
Qui natus es de Virgine,
Cum Patre et almo Spiritu,
In sempiterna saecula. Amen.

Hymn II
Come with rejoicing,
Come with gladness,
Come, all people of the erath,
See what God does for us.

Our God comes and takes on flesh from the Virgin,
The Seraphim and Cherubim sing of the Virgin and Son;
All creation glorifies the Mother of God,
From East to West.

He is God, truly  God, He is God, Word of the Father,
He is God, Son of the Virgin;
Jesus Christ, whose name is our salvation,
Jesus who assumed flesh in the Virgin.

For all people and for every faithful nation,
The sole source of salvation springs forth in Mary;
Rejoice, O veritable Spouse
Who give birth to Him in whom we are made one.

Let us give glory to God the Father,
Glory to His Son Jesus Christ the Lord,
And glory to the Spirit Counselor
Forever and ever. Amen.

Hymn III
Splendor that flowed from the bosom of the Father,
Light born of Light,
Before the world was born,
You shown in the darkness.

We worship you, Beloved Son,
Who was show every favor,
Upon you rests the grace
Of the Father who sent you.

You come into the depths of our night
For all peple in this world,
You are the source of life
And the true light.

Glory to you, O Father Most Holy,
Glory to you, O Only Son,
With the Spirit, the Comforter,
Both now and forever. Amen.

Hymn IV
Unto us a Child is given,
Christ our Savior bring release;
Counselor, Eternal Father,
God made man, and Prince of Peace.

Born of Mary, gentle virgin,
By the Spirit of the Lord;
From eternal ages spoken:
This the mighty Father's Word.

Love and truth in him shall flower,
From his strength their vigor take.
Branches that are bare shall blossom;
Joy that slept begins to wake.

Praise the everlasting Father,
And the Word, his only Son;
Praise them with the Holy Spirit,
Perfect Trinity in One. Amen.

You who alone are full of grace
Who found favor with Christ our Savior.

To give birth to the God who triumphs over evil,
The enemy trembles for he has seen mercy,
The wolf flees for the Lamb is victorious.

And the darkness cannot overcome it.

Eyes fixed toward heaven, they follow its path;

And myrrh foretells the tomb,

Will arise, smashing the gates of death.

Father, Son and Holy Spirit
Light made manifest to man,
Which shines for all ages. Amen.

THE BAPTISM OF THE LORD
FEAST

FIRST VESPERS

Hymn
When Jesus comes to be baptized,
He leaves the hidden years behind,
the years of safety and of peace,
to bear the sins of all mankind.

The Spirit of the Lord comes down,
anoints the Christ to suffering,
to preach the word, to free the bound,
and to the mourner, comfort bring.

He will not quench the dying flame,
and what is bruised he will not break,
but heal the wound injustice dealt,
and out of death his triumph make.

Our everlasting Father, praise,
with Christ, his well-beloved Son,
who with the Spirit reigns serene,
untroubled Trinity in One.

-Hamburg, 1690
