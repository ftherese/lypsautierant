\begin{verse}
All you who seek the Christ,\\
Lift your eyes on high and look,\\
For a heavenly sign has been raised for you,\\
And you will see His eternal glory.\\!

A star more radiant than the sun,\\
A light that surpasses all brilliance,\\
A message of great joy,\\
God descends in mortal flesh.\\!

The divine star shines for ever.\\
Light which will never grow dim;\\
It has pierced the darkness,\\
And the darkness cannot overcome it.\\!

The Wise Men have seen the rising star,\\
Eyes fixed toward heaven, they follow its path;\\
They come to the child of threefold destiny,\\
They offer gold, incense and myrrh.\\!

Gold heralds the King, incense proclaims the God,\\
And myrrh foretells the tomb,\\
Where God, letting His body be laid,\\
Will arise, smashing the gates of death.\\!

Glory to You, Holy Trinity,\\
Father, Son and Holy Spirit\\
Light made manifest to man,\\
Which shines for all ages. Amen.\\!
\end{verse}
