\begin{verse}
Christe, redemptor omnium,\\
Ex Patre, Patris Unice,\\
Solus ante principium\\
Natus ineffabiliter.\\!

Tu lumen, tu splendor Patris,\\
Tu spes perennis omnium,\\
Intende quas fundunt preces\\
Tui per orbem servuli.\\!

Salutis auctor, recole\\
Quod nostri quondam corporis,\\
Ex illibata Virgine\\
Nascendo, formam sumpseris.\\!

Hic praesens testatur dies,\\
Currens per anni circulum,\\
Quod solus a sede Patris\\
Mundi salus adveneris;\\!

Hunc caelum, terra, hunc mare,\\
Hunc omne quod in eis est,\\
Auctorem adventus tui\\
Ludat exsultans cantico.\\!

Nos quoque, qui sancto tuo\\
Redempti sumus sanguine,\\
Ob diem natalis tui\\
Hymnum novum concinimus\\!

Jesus, tibi sit gloria,\\
Qui natus es de Virgine,\\
Cum Patre et almo Spiritu,\\
In sempiterna saecula. Amen.\\!
\end{verse}
