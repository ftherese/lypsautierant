DECEMBER 28
Office of the Holy Innocents p. @propers:holyinnocents
(VESPERS taken from Second Vespers of the Nativity)

READING:    Eph 2:3b-5    We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest. But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love he had for us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, brought us to life with Christ (by grace you have been saved).

MAGNIFICAT:     The holy Virgin gave birth to God who became for us the frail, tender baby she nursed at her breast. Let us worship the Lord who comes to save us.
