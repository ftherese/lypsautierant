HYMN I
I will come back to my Father's house,
I will be welcomed like the Prodigal Son,
as he did, so shall I,
will He not hear my prayer?

See, I am knocking at your door, merciful Father;
open the door, bid me enter,
lest I lose my way,
lest I go astray and perish.

Like the sinful woman, pardon me, o Son of God;
like the publican, have pity on me and I will live by your grace;
like Peter amidst the waves, rescue me;
like the thief, have mercy and remember me in your Kingdom.

Like the blind man, open my eyes
that I may see your light,
like the deaf man,  heal me
that I may hear your voice.

Glory to you, o only Son,
God who is, who was, and who is to come,
yours is the Kingdom with the Father and the Holy Spirit,
now and for ever. Amen.

HYMN II
Now let us all with one accord
in fellowship with ages past,
keep vigil with our heav'nly Lord,
in hi stemptation and his fast.

The covenant, so long revealed 
to faithful men in former time,
Christ by his own example sealed,
the Lord of love, in love sublime.

This love, O Lor, we sinful men
have not returned, but falsified;
Author of mercy, turn again
and see our sorrow for our pride.

Remember, Lord, though frial we be,
by your own kind hand were we made;
and help us, lest our frailty
cause your great name to be betrayed.

Therefore we pray you, Lord, forgive;
so when our wanderings here shall cease,
we may with you for ever live,
in love and unity and peace.

Hear us, O Trinity sublime,
and undivided unity;
so let his consecrated time
bring forth its fruit abundantly.

-attributed to St Gregory the Great

HYMN III
Audi, benigne Conditor,
nostras preces cum fletibus,
sacrata in abstinentia
gusas quadragenaria.

Scrutator alme cordium,
infirma tu scis virium;
ad te recverses exhibe
remissionis gratiam.

Multum quidem peccavimus,
sed parce confitentibus,
tuique laude nominis
confer medelam languidis.

Sic corpus extra conteri
dona per abstinentiam,
ieiunet ut mens sobria
a labe prorsus criminum.

Praesta, beata Trinitas,
concede, simplex Unitas,
ut fructuosa sint tuis
haec parcitatis munera. Amen.

Week 5:  Acts 13:26-30   My brothers, children of the family of Abraham, and those others among you who are God-fearing, to us this word of salvation has been sent. The inhabitants of Jerusalem and their leaders failed to recognize him, and by condemning him they fulfilled the oracles of the prophets that are read sabbath after sabbath. For even though they found no grounds for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him put to death, and when they had accomplished all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead.

HYMN I
Vexilla regis prodeunt,
fulget crucis mysterium,
quo carne carnis conditor
suspensus est patibulo;

Quo, vulneratus insuper 
mucrone diro lanceae,
ut nos lavaret crimine,
manavit unda et sanguine.

Arbor decora et sanguine
ornata regis purpura,
electa digno stipite
tam sancta membra tangere!

Beata, cuius bracchiis
saecli pependit pretium;
statera facta est corporis
praedam tulitque tartari.

Salve, ara, salve, victima,
de passionis gloria,
qua vita mortem pertulit
et morte vitam reddidit!

O crux, ave, spes unica!
hoc passionis tempore
piis adauge gratiam
reisque dele crimina.

Te, fons salutis, Trinitas,
collaudet omnis spiritus;
quos per crucis mysterium
salvas, fove per saecula. Amen.

HYMN II
The banner of the King advances,
behold the mystery of the Cross.
On it, Life suffered death,
and through death, has given us life.

The sharp iron head of the lance
wounds the heart of the Crucified One;
the water and the blood shed
purify us from all sin.

And thus, the oracle of David is accomplished
in his inspired poetry,
he who prophesied to the nations:
God will reign by the wood.

You are lovely, dazzling with glory,
tree dressed in the purple of the King
tree chosen from a blessed root.
Worthy to touch the sacred Body.

Hail, O Cross, our only hope,
grant in these days of the Passion,
that grace and pardon bear fruit
in the hearts of the faithful.

O Trinity, source of salvation,
be lauded by all the earth,
you who let us triumph through the Cross
grant us the fullness of joy. Amen.
