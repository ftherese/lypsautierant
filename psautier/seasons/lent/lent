INVITATORY
Come, let us worship Christ the Lord, who for our sake endured temptation and suffering.
OR
Today if you hear the voice of the Lord, harden not your hearts.

Hymn I
I will come back to my Father's house,
I will be welcomed like the Prodigal Son,
as he did, so shall I,
will He not hear my prayer?

See, I am knocking at your door, merciful Father;
open the door, bid me enter,
lest I lose my way,
lest I go astray and perish.

Like the sinful woman, pardon me, o Son of God;
like the publican, have pity on me and I will live by your grace;
like Peter amidst the waves, rescue me;
like the thief, have mercy and remember me in your Kingdom.

Like the blind man, open my eyes
that I may see your light,
like the deaf man,  heal me
that I may hear your voice.

Glory to you, o only Son,
God who is, who was, and who is to come,
yours is the Kingdom with the Father and the Holy Spirit,
now and for ever. Amen.

Hymn II
Now let us all with one accord
in fellowship with ages past,
keep vigil with our heav'nly Lord,
in hi stemptation and his fast.

The covenant, so long revealed 
to faithful men in former time,
Christ by his own example sealed,
the Lord of love, in love sublime.

This love, O Lor, we sinful men
have not returned, but falsified;
Author of mercy, turn again
and see our sorrow for our pride.

Remember, Lord, though frial we be,
by your own kind hand were we made;
and help us, lest our frailty
cause your great name to be betrayed.

Therefore we pray you, Lord, forgive;
so when our wanderings here shall cease,
we may with you for ever live,
in love and unity and peace.

Hear us, O Trinity sublime,
and undivided unity;
so let his consecrated time
bring forth its fruit abundantly. Amen.

-attributed to St Gregory the Great

Hymn III
Audi, benigne Conditor,
nostras preces cum fletibus,
sacrata in abstinentia
gusas quadragenaria.

Scrutator alme cordium,
infirma tu scis virium;
ad te reverses exhibe
remissionis gratiam.

Multum quidem peccavimus,
sed parce confitentibus,
tuique laude nominis
confer medelam languidis.

Sic corpus extra conteri
dona per abstinentiam,
ieiunet ut mens sobria
a labe prorsus criminum.

Praesta, beata Trinitas,
concede, simplex Unitas,
ut fructuosa sint tuis
haec parcitatis munera. Amen.
