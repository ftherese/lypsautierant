\begin{cverse}
Vexilla regis prodeunt,\\
fulget crucis mysterium,\\
quo carne carnis conditor\\
suspensus est patibulo;\\!

Quo, vulneratus insuper \\
mucrone diro lanceae,\\
ut nos lavaret crimine,\\
manavit unda et sanguine.\\!

Arbor decora et sanguine\\
ornata regis purpura,\\
electa digno stipite\\
tam sancta membra tangere!\\!

Beata, cuius bracchiis\\
saecli pependit pretium;\\
statera facta est corporis\\
praedam tulitque tartari.\\!

Salve, ara, salve, victima,\\
de passionis gloria,\\
qua vita mortem pertulit\\
et morte vitam reddidit!\\!

O crux, ave, spes unica!\\
hoc passionis tempore\\
piis adauge gratiam\\
reisque dele crimina.\\!

Te, fons salutis, Trinitas,\\
collaudet omnis spiritus;\\
quos per crucis mysterium\\
salvas, fove per saecula. Amen.\\!
\end{cverse}

\noindent\small{\uppercase{Hymn II }}\normalsize\label{holyweek:lastHymn}
\begin{cverse}
The banner of the King advances,\\
behold the mystery of the Cross.\\
On it, Life suffered death,\\
and through death, has given us life.\\!

The sharp iron head of the lance\\
wounds the heart of the Crucified One;\\
the water and the blood shed\\
purify us from all sin.\\!

And thus, the oracle of David is accomplished\\
in his inspired poetry,\\
he who prophesied to the nations:\\
God will reign by the wood.\\!

You are lovely, dazzling with glory,\\
tree dressed in the purple of the King\\
tree chosen from a blessed root.\\
Worthy to touch the sacred Body.\\!

Hail, O Cross, our only hope,\\
grant in these days of the Passion,\\
that grace and pardon bear fruit\\
in the hearts of the faithful.\\!

O Trinity, source of salvation,\\
be lauded by all the earth,\\
you who let us triumph through the Cross\\
grant us the fullness of joy. Amen.\\!
\end{cverse}
