ADVENT SEASON

INVITATORY:
-Come, let us worship the Lord, the King who is to come.
-The Lord is close at hand; come, let us worship him.

Hymn I
Say to those whose hearts are troubled
Take courage, you need no longer fear.
See, it is your God who comes to save you,
He wants to gather his scattered children.

He will strengthen weary hand,
And steady trembling knees,
The eyes of the blind will see the light,
The tongue of the dumb will sing for joy.

The scorched earth will become a pool of water,
The parched land will be changed into a spring.
A level road will be marked there,
It will be called: the way of the Lord.

Glory to you, All-Powerful Father,
Glory to you, Christ our Savior,
Glory to you, Spirit of Truth,
Now and forever more. Amen.

Hymn II 
Conditor alme siderum,
Aeterna lux credentium,
Christe, redemptor omnium,
Exaudi preces supplicum.

Qui condolens interitu
Mortis perire saeculum,
Salvasti mundum languidum,
Donans reis remedium.

Vergente mundi vespere,
Uti sponsus de thalamo,
Egressus honestissima
Virginis matris clausula.

Cuius forti potentiae
Genu curvantur omnia:
Caelestia, terrestria
Nutu fatentur subdita.

Te, Sancte, fide quaesumus,
Venture iudex saeculi,
Conserva nos in tempore
Hostis a telo perfidi.

Sit, Christe, rex piisime,
Tibi Patrique gloria
Cum Spiritu Paraclito,
In sempiterna saecula. Amen.

Hymn III
Verbum salútis omnium,
Patris ab ore pródiens,
Virgo beáta, súscipe
Casto, Maria, viscere.

Te nunc illústrat cáelitus
Úmbra fecúndi Spiritus
Géstes ut Chrístum Dominum,
Æquálem Pátri Filium.

Hæc est sacráti iánua
Témpli seráta iúgiter
Sóli suprémo Príncipi
Pandens beáta límina.

Ólim promíssus vátibus,
Nátus áante lucíferum
Quem Gábriel anúntiat,
Térris descéndit Dóminus.

Læténtur símul ángeli,
Ómnes exsúltent pópuli:
Excélsus vénit húmilis
Salváre quod períerat.

Sit, Chríste, réx piíssime
Tíbi Patríque gloória
Cum Spiíritu Paráclito,
In sempitérna sǽcula. Amén.

Intende quas fundunt preces
Tui per orbem servuli.

The Seraphim and Cherubim sing of the Virgin and Son;
All creation glorifies the Mother of God,
From East to West.

He is God, truly  God, He is God, Word of the Father,
He is God, Son of the Virgin;

Jesus who assumed flesh in the Virgin.

For all people and for every faithful nation,
The sole source of salvation springs forth in Mary;

Glory to His Son Jesus Christ the Lord,
And glory to the Spirit Counselor
Forever and ever.

Light born of Light,
Before the world was born,
You shone in the darkness.

Who was shown every favor,
Upon you rests the grace
Of the Father who sent you.

You come into the depths of our night
For all people in this world,
You are the source of life
And the true light.

Glory to you, O Father Most Holy,
Glory to you, O Only Son,
With the Spirit, the Comforter,
Both now and for ever. Amen.

HYMN IV
Unto us a Child is given,
Christ our Savior bring release;
Counselor, Eternal Father,
God made man, and Prince of Peace.

Born of Mary, gentle virgin,
By the Spirit of the Lord;
From eternal ages spoken:
This the mighty Father's Word.

Love and truth in him shall flower,
From his strength their vigor take.
Branches that are bare shall blossom;
Joy that slept begins to wake.

Praise the everlasting Father,
And the Word, his only Son;
Praise them with the Holy Spirit,
Perfect Trinity in One.

HYMN
All you who seek the Christ,
Lift your eyes on high and look,
For a heavenly sign has been raised for you,
And you will see His eternal glory.

A star more radiant than the sun,
A light that surpasses all brilliance,
A message of great joy,
God descends in mortal flesh.

The divine star shines for ever.
Light which will never grow dim;
It has pierced the darkness,
And the darkness cannot overcome it.

The Wise Men have seen the rising star,
Eyes fixed toward heaven, they follow its path;
They come to the child of threefold destiny,
They offer gold, incense and myrrh.

Gold heralds the King, incense proclaims the God,
And myrrh foretells the tomb,
Where God, letting His body be laid,
Will arise, smashing the gates of death.

Glory to You, Holy Trinity,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit
Light made manifest to man,
Which shines for all ages. Amen.

FIRST VESPERS
HYMN
When Jesus comes to be baptized,
He leaves the hidden years behind,
the years of safety and of peace,
to bear the sins of all mankind.

The Spirit of the Lord comes down,
anoints the Christ to suffering,
to preach the word, to free the bound,
and to the mourner, comfort bring.

He will not quench the dying flame,
and what is bruised he will not break,
but heal the wound injustice dealt,
and out of death his triumph make.

Our everlasting Father, praise,
with Christ, his well-beloved Son,
who with the Spirit reigns serene,
untroubled Trinity in One.

-Hamburg, 1690

Come, let us worship Christ the Lord, who for our sake endured temptation and suffering.

Today if you hear the voice of the Lord, harden not your hearts.

HYMN I
I will come back to my Father's house,
I will be welcomed like the Prodigal Son,
as he did, so shall I,
will He not hear my prayer?

See, I am knocking at your door, merciful Father;
open the door, bid me enter,
lest I lose my way,
lest I go astray and perish.

Like the sinful woman, pardon me, o Son of God;
like the publican, have pity on me and I will live by your grace;
like Peter amidst the waves, rescue me;
like the thief, have mercy and remember me in your Kingdom.

Like the blind man, open my eyes
that I may see your light,
like the deaf man,  heal me
that I may hear your voice.

Glory to you, o only Son,
God who is, who was, and who is to come,
yours is the Kingdom with the Father and the Holy Spirit,
now and for ever. Amen.

HYMN II
Now let us all with one accord
in fellowship with ages past,
keep vigil with our heav'nly Lord,
in his temptation and his fast.

The covenant, so long revealed 
to faithful men in former time,
Christ by his own example sealed,
the Lord of love, in love sublime.

This love, O Lord, we sinful men
have not returned, but falsified;
Author of mercy, turn again
and see our sorrow for our pride.

Remember, Lord, though frail we be,
by your own kind hand were we made;
and help us, lest our frailty
cause your great name to be betrayed.

Therefore we pray you, Lord, forgive;
so when our wanderings here shall cease,
we may with you for ever live,
in love and unity and peace.

Hear us, O Trinity sublime,
and undivided unity;
so let his consecrated time
bring forth its fruit abundantly.

-attributed to St Gregory the Great

Weeks 1-4:    2 Cor 6:1-4a    Working together, then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain. For he says: “In an acceptable time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is a very acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. We cause no one to stumble in anything, in order that no fault may be found with our ministry; on the contrary, in everything we commend ourselves as ministers of God.

Week 5:    1 Pet 1:18-21    Realizing that you were ransomed from your futile conduct, handed on by your ancestors, not with perishable things like silver or gold but with the precious blood of Christ as of a spotless unblemished lamb. He was known before the foundation of the world but revealed in the final time for you, who through him believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.

Week 3:	O God, author of every mercy and of all goodness, who in fasting, prayer and almsgiving have shown us a remedy for sin, look graciously on this confession of our lowliness, that we, who are bowed down by our conscience, may always be lifted up by your mercy. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
Week 4:	O God, who through your Word reconcile the human race to yourself in a wonderful way, grant, we pray, that with prompt devotion and eager faith the Christian people may hasten toward the solemn celebrations to come.

Week 5:	By your help, we beseech you, Lord our God, may we walk eagerly in that same charity with which, out of love for the world, your Son handed himself over to death.

Ash Wednesday & Weeks 1-4:    Deut 7:6, 8-9    For you are a people holy to the LORD, your God; the LORD, your God, has chosen you from all the peoples on the face of the earth to be a people specially his own. It was because the LORD loved you and because of his fidelity to the oath he had sworn to your ancestors, that the LORD brought you out with a strong hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Know, then, that the LORD, your God, is God: the faithful God who keeps covenant mercy to the thousandth generation toward those who love him and keep his commandments.

Week 5:    Is 50:4b-7    Morning after morning he wakens my ear to hear as disciples do; the Lord GOD opened my ear; I did not refuse, did not turn away. I gave my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who tore out my beard; my face I did not hide from insults and spitting. The Lord GOD is my help, therefore I am not disgraced; therefore I have set my face like flint, knowing that I shall not be put to shame.

BENEDICTUS
Ash Wednesday:	When you fast, do not put on a gloomy face, like the hypocrites.

Week 5:	If you are faithful to my teaching, says the Lord, you will indeed be my disciples. You will know the truth and the truth will make you free.

PRAYERS
Ash Wednesday:	Grant, O Lord, that we may begin with holy fasting this campaign of Christian service, so that, as we take up battle against spiritual evils, we may be armed with weapons of self-restraint. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
Week 1:	Look kindly, Lord, we pray, on the devotion of your people, that those who by self-denial are restrained in body may by the fruit of good works be renewed in mind. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.

Week 3:	Grant, we pray, O Lord, that, schooled through Lenten observance and nourished by your word, through holy restraint we may be devoted to you with all our heart and be ever united in prayer.

Week 4:	O God, who reward the merits of the just and offer pardon to sinners who do penance, have mercy, we pray, on those who call upon you, that the admission of our guilt may serve to obtain your pardon for our sins. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.
Week 5:	Enlighten, O God of compassion, the hearts of your children, sanctified by penance, and in your kindness grant those you stir to a sense of devotion a gracious hearing when they cry out to you.

Week 5:    Heb 2:9-10    but we do see Jesus “crowned with glory and honor” because he suffered death, he who “for a little while” was made “lower than the angels,” that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.

Week 5:    Heb 7:26-27    It was fitting that we should have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, higher than the heavens.

HYMN I
HYMN OF THE PASSION
Vixen regis prudent,
fulget crucis mysterium,
quo carne carnis coeditor
suspensus est patibulo;

Quo, vulneratus insuper 
mucrone diro lance,
out nos lavaret crimine,
manavit unda et sanguine.

Arbor decora et sanguine
ornata regis purpura,
electa digno stipite
tam sancta membra tangere!

Beata, cuius bracchiis
saecli pependit pretium;
statera facta est corporis
praedam tulitque tartari.

Salve, ara, salve, victima,
de passionis gloria,
qua vita mortem pertulit
et morte vitam reddidit!

O crux, ave, spes unica!
hoc passionis tempore
piis adauge gratiam
reisque dele crimina.

Te, fons salutis, Trinitas,
collaudet omnis spiritus;
quos per crucis mysterium
salvas, fove per saecula. Amen.

Saint Venance Fortunat (Bishop of Poitiers), 7th Century

HYMN II
HYMN OF THE PASSION translated
The banner of the King advances,
behold the mystery of the Cross.
On it, Life suffered death,
and through death, has given us life.

The sharp iron head of the lance
wounds the heart of the Crucified One;
the water and the blood shed
purify us from all sin.

And thus, the oracle of David is accomplished
in his inspired poetry,
he who prophesied to the nations:
God will reign by the wood.

You are lovely, dazzling with glory,
tree dressed in the purple of the King
tree chosen from a blessed root.
Worthy to touch the sacred Body.

Hail, O Cross, our only hope,
grant in these days of the Passion,
that grace and pardon bear fruit
in the hearts of the faithful.

O Trinity, source of salvation,
be lauded by all the earth,
you who let us triumph through the Cross
grant us the fullness of joy. Amen.

READING:    Heb 2:9-10    But we do see Jesus “crowned with glory and honor” because he suffered death, he who “for a little while” was made “lower than the angels,” that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. For it was fitting that he, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many children to glory, should make the leader to their salvation perfect through suffering.

BENEDICTUS:	I have longed to eat this meal with you before I suffer.

For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the one that is to come. Through him [then] let us continually offer God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.

MAGNIFICAT:	While they were at supper, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke the bread and gave it to his disciples.

The Lord is risen, alleluia.

HYMN I
Clothed in shining garments
for the Lamb's royal wedding feast,
we who have crossed the Red Sea,
sing of Christ our King.

If we partake of his Body most holy
immolated on the altar of the Cross,
if we drink his precious Blood,
we live in God and God in us.

By water, he rescued us from the enemy,
by his Blood, he saved us from destruction,
Christ is for us the Paschal Victim,
his Flesh, the unleavened bread of our lives.

O true Victim who triumphs over hell,
you break our bonds by giving us life;
by rising victorious from the grave,
O Christ, you open for us the gates of Paradise.

Glory to you, O Risen Christ,
you, our true Easter joy,
glory to your Father and to the Spirit most holy,
for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia!

Cuius corpus sanctissimum
in ara crucis torridum,
sed et cruorem roseum
gustando, Deo vivimus.

Protecti paschae vespero
a devastante angelo,
de Pharaonis aspero
sumus erepti imperio.

Iam pascha nostrum Christus est,
agnus occisus innocens;
sinceritatis azyma
qui carnem suam obtulit.

O vera, digna hostia,
per quam granguntur tartara,
captiva plebs redimitur,
redduntur vitae praemia!

Consurgit Christus tumulo,
victor redit de barathro,
tyrannum trudens vinculo
et paradisum reserans.

Esto perenne mentibus
paschale, Iesu, gaudium
et nos renatos gratiae
tuis triumphis aggrega.

qui morte victa praenites,
cum Patre et almo Spiritu,

O death, where is your victory?
Over you, Christ has triumphed.
He has unmasked your empire.
O death, tell us where is your sting?

God has granted deliverance,

God bestows his light upon us.

There is an indestructible Temple,
its corner stone is Jesus Christ;
our Savior is its only light.
A new Temple established by God.

Joy in the heavens and on earth,

who gives his life for all mankind.
The joy of salvation offered to all.

1st-6th Week:    Heb 7:24-27    But he, because he remains forever, has a priesthood that does not pass away. Therefore, he is always able to save those who approach God through him, since he lives forever to make intercession for them. It was fitting that we should have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, higher than the heavens. He has no need, as did the high priests, to offer sacrifice day after day, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did that once for all when he offered himself. 

7th Week:    1 Cor 2:9b-10    But as it is written: “What eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and what has not entered the human heart, what God has prepared for those who love him,” this God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit scrutinizes everything, even the depths of God.

For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you want. But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, hatreds, rivalry, jealousy, outbursts of fury, acts of selfishness, dissensions, factions, occasions of envy, drinking bouts, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. In contrast, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ [Jesus] have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, let us also follow the Spirit. Let us not be conceited, provoking one another, envious of one another.

HYMN
God, with hidden majesty, lies in presence here,
I, with deep devotion, my true God revere:
Whom this outward shape and form secretly contains,
Christ in his divinity manhood still retains.

All my other senses cannot now perceive,
But my hearing, taught by faith, always will believe:
I accept whatever God the Son has said:
Those who hear the word of God, by the truth are fed.

God lay stretched upon the cross, only man could die,
Here upon the altar God and man both lie;
This I firmly hold true, this is my belief,
And I seek salvation, like the dying thief.

Wounds that doubting Thomas saw I could never see,
But I still acknowledge you my true God to be;
Grant that I shall always keep strong in faith and trust,
Guided by my Savior, merciful and just.

Blest reminder of the death suffered for mankind,
Sacrament of living bread, health to every mind,
Let my soul approach you, live within your grace,
Let me taste the perfect joys time shall not efface.

SECOND VESPERS
HYMN
I shall praise the Savior's glory,
Of his flesh the mystery sing,
And the blood, all price excelling,
Shed by our immortal King:
God made man for our salvation,
Who from Virgin pure did spring.

Born for us, and for us given,
Born a man like us below,
Christ as man with man residing,
Lived the seed of truth to sow,
Suffered bitter death unflinching,
And immortal love did show.

On the night before he suffered,
Seated with his chosen band,
Jesus, when they all had feasted,
Faithful to the law's command,
Far more precious food provided:
Gave himself with his own hand.

Word made flesh, true bread of heaven
By his word made flesh to be;
From the wine his blood is taken,
Though our senses cannot see;
Faith alone which is unshaken
Shows pure hearts the mystery.

Therefore we, before him falling,
This great sacrament revere;
Ancient forms are now departed,
For new acts of grace are here;
Faith our feeble senses aiding,
Makes the Savior's presence clear.

To the everlasting Father
And his Son who reigns on high,
With the Holy Ghost proceeding
Forth from each eternally,
Be all honor, glory, blessing,
Power and endless majesty.

ORDINARY TIME



HYMN FOR FIRST VESPERS OF SUNDAY
Now thank we all our God
With heart and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things has done,
In whom his world rejoices;
Who from our mothers' arms
Has blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.

O may this gracious God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts,
And blessed peace to cheer us;
Preserve us in his grace,
And guide us in distress,
And free us form all sin,
Till heaven we possess.

All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son and Spirit blest,
Who reigns in highest heaven;
Eternal, Triune God,
Whom earth and heaven adore;
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be ever more.

HYMN FOR FIRST VESPERS OF SUNDAY
At the name of Jesus
Ev'ry knee shall bow,
Ev'ry tongue confess him
King of glory now;
'Tis the Father's pleasure,
We should call him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the mighty Word.

Humbled for a reason,
To receive a name
From the lips of sinners,
Unto whom he came,
Faithfully he bore it,
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death he passed.

Bore it up triumphant,
With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
To the central height,
To the throne of Godhead,
To the Father's breast;
Filled it with the glory
Of that perfect rest.

In your hearts enthrone him
There, let him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true;
May your voice entreat him
In temptation's hour;
Let his will enfold you
In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again,
With his Father's glory,
O'er the earth to reign;
He is God the Savior,
He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped,
Always blest, adored.
-C. Noel, 1877

HYMN
Our King comes in his great glory
To delight us with his glorious light;
Let us light our lamps and go forth to meet him.
Let us rejoice in him as he rejoices in us.

Daylight has dawned upon mankind,
The power of darkness is dispelled,
From its light breaks the light
That enlightens our clouded eyes.

He has made his glory rise upon the world,
He has shed light on the depths of the abyss.
Death is destroyed, darkness is no more,
The gates of hell are shattered.

He has enlightened every creature,
The dead who lay in the dust have been raised,
They give glory to the Almighty Lord,
For he has brought them salvation.

He has accomplished salvation and has given us life,
He has been raised up to his Father,
He will come back in his great glory
To bring light to the eyes of those who have waited for him.

His day will dawn like lightning,
And his saints will go forth to meet him,
All those who have prepared themselves in fatigue and sorrow,
Holding lighted lamps in their hands.

Glory to You, most loving Father,
Glory to You, risen Son,
And praise to the Spirit of Truth
For ever and ever. Amen.
-Saint Ephrem

HYMN FOR SECOND VESPERS OF SUNDAY
O Christ, you are the light and day
Which drives away the night,
The ever shining Sun of God
And pledge of future light.

As now the ev'ning shadows fall
Please grant us, Lord, we pray,
A quiet night to rest in you
Until the break of day.

Remember us, poor mortal men,
We humbly ask, O Lord,
And may your presence in our souls
Be now our great reward.

HYMN FOR WEEKDAYS
O Father, whose creating hand
Brings harvest from the fruitful land,
Your providence we gladly own,
And bring our hymns before your throne
To praise you for the living bread
On which our lives are daily fed.

O Lord, who in the desert fed
The hungry thousands in their need,
Where want and famine still abound
Let your relieving love be found,
And in your name may we supply
Your hungry children when they cry.

O Spirit, your revealing light
Has led our questing souls aright
Source of our science, you have taught
The marvels human minds have wrought,
So that the barren deserts yield
The bounty by your love revealed.

HYMN FOR WEEKDAYS
Lord Jesus Christ, abide with us,
Now that the sun has run its course;
Let hope not be obscured by night,
But may faith's darkness be as light.

Lord Jesus Christ, grant us your peace,
And when the trials of earth shall cease,
Grant us the morning light of grace,
The radiant splendor of your face.

Immortal, Holy, Threefold Light,
Yours be the kingdom, pow'r, and might;
All glory be eternally
To you, life-giving Trinity!

HYMN
God, whose almighty word
Chaos and darkness heard
And took their flight:
Hear us, we humbly pray,
And where the Gospel day
Sheds not its glorious ray
Let there be light.

Savior, who came to bring
On your redeeming wing
Healing and sight--
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly bling--
O now to all mankind
Let there be light.

Spirit of truth and love,
Life-giving holy dove,
Speed on your flight;
Move on the water's face,
Bearing the lamp of grace,
And in earth's darkest place
Let there be light.

Holy and blessed Three,
Glorious Trinity,
Wisdom, Love, Might,
Boundless as ocean-tide
Rolling in fullest pride,
Through the world, far and wide
Let there be light.
-John Marriott, 1780-1825

HYMN FOR VESPERS ON FRIDAY
When, in his own image
God created man,
He included freedom
In creation's plan.
For he loved us even
From before our birth;
By his grace he made us
Freemen of this earth.

God to man entrusted
Life as gift and aim.
Sin became our prison,
Turning hope to shame.
Man against his brother
Lifted hand and sword,
And the Father's pleading
Went unseen, unheard.

Then in time, our maker
Chose to intervene,
Set his love in person
In the human scene.
Jesus broke the circle
Of repeated sin,
So that man's devotion
Newly might begin.

Choose we now in freedom
Where we should belong.
Let us turn to Jesus,
Let our choice be strong.
May the great obedience
Which in Christ we see
Perfect all our service
Then we shall be free!
