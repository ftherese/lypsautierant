Hymn I
Say to those whose hearts are troubled
Take courage, you need no longer fear.
See, it is your God who comes to save you,
He wants to gather his scattered children.

He will strengthen weary hand,
And steady trembling knees,
The eyes of the blind will see the light,
The tongue of the dumb will sing for joy.

The scorched earth will become a pool of water,
The parched land will be changed into a spring.
A level road will be marked there,
It will be called: the way of the Lord.

Glory to you, All-Powerful Father,
Glory to you, Christ our Savior,
Glory to you, Spirit of Truth,
Now and forever more. Amen.

HymnII
Conditor alme siderum,
Aeterna lux credentium,
Christe, redemptor omnium,
Exaudi preces supplicum.

Qui condolens interitu
Mortis perire saeculum,
Salvasti mundum languidum,
Donans reis remedium.

Vergente mundi vespere,
Uti sponsus de thalamo,
Egressus honestissima
Virginis matris clausula.

Cuius forti potentiae
Genu curvantur omnia:
Caelestia, terrestria
Nutu fatentur subdita.

Te, Sancte, fide quaesumus,
Venture iudex saeculi,
Conserva nos in tempore
Hostis a telo perfidi.

Sit, Christe, rex piisime,
Tibi Patrique gloria
Cum Spiritu Paraclito,
In sempiterna saecula. Amen.
