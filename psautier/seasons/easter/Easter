EASTER

EASTER SEASON

INVITATORY
The Lord is risen, alleluia.

Hymn I
Clothed in shining garments
for the Lamb's royal wedding feast,
we who have crossed the Red Sea,
sing of Christ our King.

If we partake of his Body most holy
immolated on the altar of the Cross,
if we drink his precious Blood,
we live in God and God in us.

By water, he rescued us from the enemy,
by his Blood, he saved us from destruction,
Christ is for us the Paschal Victim,
his Flesh, the unleavened bread of our lives.

O true Victim who triumphs over hell,
you break our bonds by giving us life;
by rising victorious from the grave,
O Christ, you open for us the gates of Paradise.

Glory to you, O Risen Christ,
you, our true Easter joy,
glory to your Father and to the Spirit most holy,
for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia!

- Ambrosienne

Hymn II (transaltion of hymn I)
Ad cenam Agni providi,
stolis salutis candidi,
post transitum maris Rubri
Christo canamus principi.

Cuius corpus sanctissimum
in ara crucis torridum,
sed et cruorem roseum
gustando, Deo vivimus.

Protecti paschae vespero
a devastante angelo,
de Pharaonis aspero
sumus erepti imperio.

Iam pascha nostrum Christus est,
agnus occisus innocens;
sinceritatis azyma
qui carnem suam obtulit.

O vera, digna hostia,
per quam granguntur tartara,
captiva plebs redimitur,
redduntur vitae praemia!

Consurgit Christus tumulo,
victor redit de barathro,
tyrannum trudens vinculo
et paradisum reserans.

Esto perenne mentibus
paschale, Iesu, gaudium
et nos renatos gratiae
tuis triumphis aggrega.

Iesu, tibi sit gloria,
qui morte victa praenites,
cum Patre et almo Spiritu,
in sempiterna saecula. Amen.

Hymn III
O death, where is your victory?
Over you, Christ has triumphed.
He has unmasked your empire.
O death, tell us where is your sting?

God has granted deliverance, 
and emerging from his tomb
he has acquired a new people.
God bestows his light upon us.

There is an indestructible Temple,
its corner stone is Jesus Christ;
our Savior is its only light.
A new Temple established by God.

Joy in the heavens and on earth,
at the coming of the triumphant King,
who gives his life for all mankind.
The joy of salvation offered to all.

Glory and praise to our Father,
through Jesus Christ resurrected,
in the Holy Spirit who unites us.
Glory to the Holy Trinity. Amen.

Hymn I
Veni, creator Spiritus,
mentes tuorum visita,
imple superna gratia,
quae tu creasti, pectora.

Qui diceris Paraclitus,
donum Dei altissimi,
fons vivus, ignis, caritas
et spiritalis unctio.

Tu septiformis munere,
dextrae Dei tu digitus,
tu rite promissum Patris
sermone ditans guttura.

Accende lumen sensibus,
infunde amorem cordibus,
infirma nostri corporis,
virtute firmans perpeti.

Hostem repellas longius
pacemque dones protinus;
ductore sic te praevio
vitemus omne noxium.

Per te sciamus da Patrem
noscamus atque Filium,
te utriusque Spiritum
credamus omni tempore. Amen.
- Attributed to Raban Maur, 9th Century

Hymn II
Veni Sancte Spiritus,
Et emitte caelitus
Lucis tuae radium

Veni pater pauperum,
Veni dator munerum
Veni lumen cordium.

Consolator optime,
Dulcis hospes animae
Dulce refrigerium.

In labore requies,
In aestu temperies,
In fletu solatium.

O Lux beatissima,
Reple cordis intima
Tuorum fidelium.

Sine tuo numine,
Nihil est in homine,
Nihil est innoxium.

Lava quod est sordidum,
Riga quod est aridum,
Sana quod est saucium.

Flecte quod est rigidum,
Fove quod est frigidum,
Rege quod est devium.

Da tuis fidelibus,
In te confidentibus,
Sacrum septenarium.

Da virtutus meritum,
Da salutis exitum,
Da perenne gaudium. Amen.
