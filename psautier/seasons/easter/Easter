EASTER SEASON

INVITATORY
The Lord is risen, alleluia.

Hymn I #easter:firstHymn
Clothed in shining garments
for the Lamb's royal wedding feast,
we who have crossed the Red Sea,
sing of Christ our King.

If we partake of his Body most holy
immolated on the altar of the Cross,
if we drink his precious Blood,
we live in God and God in us.

By water, he rescued us from the enemy,
by his Blood, he saved us from destruction,
Christ is for us the Paschal Victim,
his Flesh, the unleavened bread of our lives.

O true Victim who triumphs over hell,
you break our bonds by giving us life;
by rising victorious from the grave,
O Christ, you open for us the gates of Paradise.

Glory to you, O Risen Christ,
you, our true Easter joy,
glory to your Father and to the Spirit most holy,
for ever and ever. Amen. Alleluia!

Hymn II (transaltion of hymn I)
Ad cenam Agni providi,
stolis salutis candidi,
post transitum maris Rubri
Christo canamus principi.

Cuius corpus sanctissimum
in ara crucis torridum,
sed et cruorem roseum
gustando, Deo vivimus.

Protecti paschae vespero
a devastante angelo,
de Pharaonis aspero
sumus erepti imperio.

Iam pascha nostrum Christus est,
agnus occisus innocens;
sinceritatis azyma
qui carnem suam obtulit.

O vera, digna hostia,
per quam granguntur tartara,
captiva plebs redimitur,
redduntur vitae praemia!

Consurgit Christus tumulo,
victor redit de barathro,
tyrannum trudens vinculo
et paradisum reserans.

Esto perenne mentibus
paschale, Iesu, gaudium
et nos renatos gratiae
tuis triumphis aggrega.

Iesu, tibi sit gloria,
qui morte victa praenites,
cum Patre et almo Spiritu,
in sempiterna saecula. Amen.

Hymn III #easter:lastHymn
O death, where is your victory?
Over you, Christ has triumphed.
He has unmasked your empire.
O death, tell us where is your sting?

God has granted deliverance, 
and emerging from his tomb
he has acquired a new people.
God bestows his light upon us.

There is an indestructible Temple,
its corner stone is Jesus Christ;
our Savior is its only light.
A new Temple established by God.

Joy in the heavens and on earth,
at the coming of the triumphant King,
who gives his life for all mankind.
The joy of salvation offered to all.

Glory and praise to our Father,
through Jesus Christ resurrected,
in the Holy Spirit who unites us.
Glory to the Holy Trinity. Amen.
