Psalm 41(40) Beatus qui intelligit

2 Happy the man who considers the poor and the weak.
The Lord will save him in the day of evil,
3 will guard him, give him life, make him happy in the land
and will not give him up to the will of his foes.
4 The Lord will help him on his bed of pain,
he will bring him back from sickness to health.

5 As for me, I said: "Lord, have mercy on me,
heal my soul for I have sinned against you."
6 My foes are speaking evil against me.
"how long before he dies and his name be forgotten?"
7 They come to visit me and speak empty words,
their hearts full of malice, they spread it abroad.

8 My enemies whisper together against me.
They all weigh up the evil which is on me.
9 "Some deadly thing has fastened upon him,
he will not rise again from where he lies."
10 Thus even my friend, in whom I trusted,
who ate my bread, has turned against me.

11 But you, O Lord, have mercy on me.
Let me rise once more and I will repay them.
12 By this I shall know that you are my friend,
if my foes do not shout in triumph over me.
13 If you uphold me I shall be unharmed
and set in your presence for ever more.


14 Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel
from age to age. Amen. Amen.
