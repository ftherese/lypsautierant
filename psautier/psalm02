Psalm 2(2) Quare fremuerunt gentes

1 Why this tumult among nations,
among peoples this useless murmuring?
2 They arise, the kings of the earth,
princes plot against the Lord and his Anointed.
3 "Come, let us break their fetters,
come, let us cast off their yoke."

4 He who sits in the heavens laughs;
the Lord is laughing them to scorn.
5 Then he will speak in his anger,
his rage will strike them with terror.
6 "It is I who have set up my king on Zion,
my holy mountain."

7 (I will announce the decree of the Lord:)

The Lord said to me: "You are my Son.
It is I who have begotten you this day.
8 Ask and I will shall bequeath you the nations,
put the ends of the earth in your possession.
9 With a rod of iron you will break them,
shatter them like a potter's jar."

10 Now, O kings, understand,
take warning, rulers of the earth;
11 serve the Lord with awe
and trembling, pay him your homage
12 lest he be angry and you perish;
for suddenly his anger will blaze.

Blessed are they who put their trust in God.
