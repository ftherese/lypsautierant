INSTALL
a. You need build-essentials. (apt install build-essential)
1. You need PurePerl: cpan -i Text::Unaccent::PurePerl
2. Lilypond - http://lilypond.org - testing with the most recent version.  Version 2.16 tested and working.
3. XeTeX - ubuntu needs texlive-xetex and deps.
4. Certain fonts are expected to be installed... I hope you have the rights to them...
5. To test and see that everything is working, run ./createPsalter.sh english test; ./sampleBuildTheBookCommand.sh test test;
6. If it all executed correctly you should have: test/test.pdf.
7. If not let me know.  An early error means lilypond is choking, check the right version is being used.
8. export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1; (I'll fix this later.)
9. Help fix the accents using vim: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/12988/how-to-add-accent-to-letters-in-normal-mode
