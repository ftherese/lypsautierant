INSTALL
a. You need build-essentials. (apt install build-essential)
1. You need PurePerl: cpan -i Text::Unaccent::PurePerl
2. Lilypond - http://lilypond.org - version 2.18 current and working.  Version 2.16 also working.
3. XeTeX - ubuntu needs texlive-xetex and deps.
4. Install svn (apt install subversion) - svn co http://github.com/ftherese/lypsautierant
5. Certain fonts are expected to be installed... I hope you have the rights to them... (Ubuntu systems: put fonts in ~/.local/share/fonts or /usr/share/fonts, then fc-cache -f -v).
6. To test and see that everything is working, run ./createPsalter.sh english test; ./sampleBuildTheBookCommand.sh test test;
7. If it all executed correctly you should have: test/test.pdf.
8. If not let me know.  An early error means lilypond is choking, check the right version is being used.
9. export PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC=1; (I'll fix this later.)
10. Help fix the accents using vim: https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/12988/how-to-add-accent-to-letters-in-normal-mode
11. Install additional fonts for the title page (Ubuntu): https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/212600/installing-missing-fonts-in-texlive-on-ubuntu
