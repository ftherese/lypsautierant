INSTALL
1. You need PurePerl: cpan -i Text::Unaccent::PurePerl
2. Lilypond - http://lilypond.org - testing with the most recent version.  Version 2.16 tested and working.
3. XeTeX - ubuntu needs texlive-xetex and deps.
4. Certain fonts are expected to be installed... I hope you have the rights to them...
5. To test and see that everything is working, run ./createPsalter.sh english test; ./sampleBuildTheBookCommand.sh test test;
6. If it all executed correctly you should have: test/test.pdf.
7. If not let me know.  An early error means lilypond is choking, check the right version is being used.
8. Something isn't working with the new install of Perl, no error is given but no text is produced.
