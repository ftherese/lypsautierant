1	Why this tumult among nations,
among peoples this useless murmuring?
2	They arise, the kings of the earth,
princes plot against the Lord and his Anointed.
3	"Come, let us break their fetters,
come, let us cast off their yoke."

4	He who sits in the heavens laughs;
the Lord is laughing them to scorn.
5	Then he will speak in his anger,
his rage will strike them with terror.
6	"It is I who have set up my king on Zion,
my holy mountain."
