Psalm 30(29) Exaltabo te, Domine

2 I will praise you, Lord, you have rescued me
and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.

* * *

3 O Lord, I cried to you for help
and you, my God, have healed me.
4 O Lord, you have raised my soul from the dead,
restored me to life from those who sink into the grave.

5 Sing psalms to the Lord, you who love him,
give thanks to his holy name.
6 His anger lasts a moment; his favor all through life.
At night there are tears, but joy comes with dawn.

7 I said to myself in my good fortune:
"Nothing will ever disturb me."
8 Your favor had set me on a mountain fastness,
then you hid your face and I was put to confusion.

9 To you, Lord, I cried,
to my God I made appeal:
10 "What profit would my death be, my going to the grave?
Can dust give you praise or proclaim your truth?

11 The Lord listened and had pity.
The Lord came to my help.
12 For me you have changed my mourning into dancing,
you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy.
13 So my soul sings psalms to you unceasingly.
O Lord my God, I will thank you for ever.
