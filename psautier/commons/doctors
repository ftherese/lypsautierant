HYMN
Make us worthy, Lord, in your kindness,
To enter the assembly of the Saints,
Blessed is he who contemplates your face,
Towards him your splendor fl ows like a river.
For our sake you handed over your Son,
His Body is with us,
With us his Truth,
He came down to give us the keys of Paradise.
625COMMONS
Who then has ever seen such an assembly,
Nourished with glory, clothed in light,
Arrayed in splendor,
Replete with happiness?
On their lips are fountains of wisdom,
Peace in their thoughts, Truth in their knowledge,
Fear of the Lord remains in their pursuits,
Love in their praise.
Grant us, Lord, the fullness of your gifts,
Th e sight of your Beloved is source of all delight!
Whoever contemplates you is nourished by your beauty,
May your Splendor be praised, O Eternal Trinity! Amen.
