COMMON OF THE BLESSED VIRGIN MARY
HYMN I
Ave, maris stella,
Dei mater alma,
Atque semper virgo,
Felix caeli porta
Sumens illud “Ave”
Gabrielis ore,
Funda nos in pace,
Mutans Evae nomen. Monstra te esse matrem,
Sumat per te preces
Qui pro nobis natus
Tulit esse tuus.
Virgo singularis,
Inter omnes mitis,
Nos culpis solutos
Mites fac et castos.
Solve vincla reis,
Profer lumen caecis,
Mala nostra pelle,
Bona cuncta posce Vitam praesta puram,
Iter para tutum,
Ut videntes Iesum
Semper collaetemur.
Sit laus Deo Patri,
Summo Christo decus,
Spiritui Sancto
Tribus, Honor unus. Amen

HYMN II
Th e God whom earth and sea and sky
Adore and laud and magnify,
Whose might they own, whose praise they tell,
In Mary’s body deigned to dwell.
O Mother blest! the chosen shrine
Wherein the Architect divine,
Whose hand contains the earth and sky,
Vouchsafed in hidden guise to lie:
Blest in the message Gabriel brought;
Blest in the work the Spirit wrought;
Most blest, to bring to human birth
Th e long desired of all the earth.
O Lord, the Virgin born, to thee
Eternal praise and glory be,
Whom with the Father we adore
And Holy Spirit for ever more. Amen
HYMN III
O You whose every thought is full of tenderness,
You, who are accustomed to loving men,
You ask for mercy,
O Mary, surrounded by the rampart of the Cross
O You, whose thoughts are full of tenderness, jewel case of the
Lord,
You whom His right hand has fashioned, take pity on me, Virgin
Mary,
If you intercede for me, will your Son not listen to you?
At your request, He poured out an abundance of nuptial wine.
Mary, you who lead sinners to repentance,
May your prayer sustain me in every temptation,
Do not allow me to be separated from you,
Mary, you who are the hope of sinners on earth.
Give glory to the Eternal Father,
To his Son born of a Virgin,
To the Spirit who overshadowed her,
For ever and ever. Amen.

HYMN IV
Mother of Christ, our Hope, our Patroness,
Star of the sea, our beacon in distress,
Guide to the shores of everlasting day,
God’s holy people on their pilgrim way.
Virgin by vow and Mother of grace,
Chosen by God to be his dwelling-place,
Blessed are you: God’s word you did believe,
Your “yes” undid the “no” of sinful Eve.
Daughter of God, who bore his holy One,
Dearest of all, the Christ, your loving Son,
Show us his face, O Mother, as on earth,
Loving us all, you gave our Savior birth.

READING Rev 12:1-6 A great portent appeared in heaven, a woman
clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her
head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out
in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. And another portent
appeared in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads
and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. His tail swept
down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth.
And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear
a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth;
she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations
with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his
throne, and the woman fl ed into the wilderness, where she has a
place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand
two hundred and sixty days.
MAGNIFICAT :
Blessed are you, O Virgin Mary, for your great faith;
all that the Lord promised you will come to pass through you
(alleluia).
