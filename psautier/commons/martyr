FOR ONE MARTYR
HYMN
Savior of the world and Lord of glory,
He who has given himself completely to you,
Who has followed you to the point of losing his life,
You shower him with the treasures of your love.
You have put your trust in his heart
To be the grain that is buried and dies.
Immolated with you, source of new life,
He was crushed like you, Bread of the Father.
Before his body, his spirit embraced your cross.
Th e blows and insults were joy for him.
Your spirit of holiness, wonderful Paraclete,
Was upon his lips to answer his accusers.
He sings the Father’s eternal praises.
In you, O Christ, he lives forever.
Th e Spirit has made his perpetual dwelling in him.
Holy Trinity, joy of martrys, glory to you. Amen.
