OFFICE FOR THE DEAD
HYMN
Remember those, O Lord,
Who in your peace have died,
Yet may not gain love’s high reward
Till love is purifi ed!
With you they faced death’s night,
Sealed with your victory sign,
Soon may the splendor of your light
On them for ever shine!
Sweet is their pain, yet deep,
Till perfect love is born;
Th eir lone night-watch they gladly keep
Before your radiant morn!
Your love is their great joy;
Your will their one desire;
As fi nest gold without alloy
Refi ne them in love’s fi re!

Perfect them in your love!
O may we share eternal day
With them in heaven above.

Lord God, you are the glory of believers and the life of the just.

him (her) the joy and blessings of the life to come. We ask this...

Saints. We ask this...
