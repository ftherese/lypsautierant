Psalm 38

2 O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger;
reprove me not in your rage.
3 For your arrows have sunk deep in me;
your hand has come down upon me.

4 There is no soundness in my flesh
because of your anger:
there is no health in my limbs
because of my sin.

5 My guilt towers higher than my head;
it is a weight too heavy to bear.
6 My wounds are foul and festering,
the result of my own folly.
7 I am bowed and brought to my knees.
I go mourning all the day long.

8 All my frame is burning with fever;
there is no soundness in my flesh.
9 I am spent and utterly crushed,
I cry aloud in anguish of heart.

10 O Lord, all my longing lies before you;
my groans are not hidden from you.
11 My heart throbs, my strength is spent;
the very light has gone from my eyes.

12 Friends and companions stand aloof from my pain;
those closest to me stand afar off.
13 Those who plot against my life lay snares;
those who seek my ruin speak of harm,
planning treachery all the day long.

14 But I, like someone deaf, do not hear;
like someone mute, I do not open my mouth.
15 I am like one who hears nothing,
in whose mouth is no defense.

16 But in you, O Lord, I hope;
it is you, Lord my God, who will answer.
17 I pray, “Let them not gloat over me,
exult if my foot should slip.”

18 For I am on the point of falling,
and my pain is always with me.
19 I confess that I am guilty;
and I am grieved because of my sin.

20  My wanton enemies live on and grow strong,
and many are my lying foes.
21 They repay me evil for good,
and attack me for seeking what is good.

22 Forsake me not, O Lord!
My God, be not far from me!
23 Make haste and come to my help,
my Lord and my salvation!

Now and forever. Amen.
