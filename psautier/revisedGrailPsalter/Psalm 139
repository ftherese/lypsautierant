Psalm 139

1 O LÓRD, you séarch me and you knów me.
2 You yoursélf know my résting and my rísing;
you discérn my thóughts from afár.
3 You márk when I wálk or lie dówn;
you knów all my wáys through and thróugh.

4 Before éver a wórd is on my tóngue,
you knów it, O LÓRD, through and thróugh.
5 Behínd and befóre, you besíege me,
your hánd ever láid upón me.
6 Too wónderful for mé, this knówledge;
too hígh, beyónd my réach.

7 O whére can I gó from your spírit,
or whére can I flée from your fáce?
8 If I clímb the héavens, you are thére.
If I líe in the gráve, you are thére.

9 If I táke the wíngs of the dáwn
or dwéll at the séa’s furthest énd,
10 even thére your hánd would léad me;
your right hánd would hóld me fást.

11 If I sáy, ``Let the dárkness híde me
and the líght aróund me be níght,"
12 even dárkness is not dárk to yóu,
the níght shall be as bríght as dáy,
and dárkness the sáme as the líght.

13 For it was yóu who fórmed my inmost béing,
knit me togéther in my móther’s wómb.
14 I thánk you who wónderfully máde me;
how wónderful áre your wórks,
which my sóul knows wéll!

15 My fráme was not hídden from yóu,
when Í was being fáshioned in sécret
and mólded in the dépths of the éarth.

16 Your éyes saw me yét unfórmed;
and all dáys are recórded in your bóok,
formed before óne of them cáme into béing.

17 To me how précious your thóughts, O Gód;
how gréat is the súm of thém!
18 If I cóunt them, they are móre than the sánd;
at the énd I am stíll at your síde.

19 O Gód, that you would sláy the wícked,
that men of blóod would depárt from mé!
20 With decéit they rebél agáinst you,
and sét your desígns at náught.

21 Do Í not hate thóse who hate yóu,
abhor thóse who ríse against yóu?
22 I háte them with a pérfect háte,
and théy are fóes to mé.

23 O séarch me, Gód, and know my héart.
O tést me, and knów my thóughts.
24 Sée that my páth is not wícked,
and léad me in the wáy everlásting.
