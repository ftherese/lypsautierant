Psalm 139

1 O LORD, you search me and you know me.
2 You yourself know my resting and my rising;
you discern my thoughts from afar.
3 You mark when I walk or lie down;
you know all my ways through and through.

4 Before ever a word is on my tongue,
you know it, O LORD, through and through.
5 Behind and before, you besiege me,
your hand ever laid upon me.
6 Too wonderful for me, this knowledge;
too high, beyond my reach.

7 O where can I go from your spirit,
or where can I flee from your face?
8 If I climb the heavens, you are there.
If I lie in the grave, you are there.

9 If I take the wings of the dawn
or dwell at the sea’s furthest end,
10 even there your hand would lead me;
your right hand would hold me fast.

11 If I say, ``Let the darkness hide me
and the light around me be night,"
12 even darkness is not dark to you,
the night shall be as bright as day,
and darkness the same as the light.

13 For it was you who formed my inmost being,
knit me together in my mother’s womb.
14 I thank you who wonderfully made me;
how wonderful are your works,
which my soul knows well!

15 My frame was not hidden from you,
when I was being fashioned in secret
and molded in the depths of the earth.

16 Your eyes saw me yet unformed;
and all days are recorded in your book,
formed before one of them came into being.

17 To me how precious your thoughts, O God;
how great is the sum of them!
18 If I count them, they are more than the sand;
at the end I am still at your side.

19 O God, that you would slay the wicked,
that men of blood would depart from me!
20 With deceit they rebel against you,
and set your designs at naught.

21 Do I not hate those who hate you,
abhor those who rise against you?
22 I hate them with a perfect hate,
and they are foes to me.

23 O search me, God, and know my heart.
O test me, and know my thoughts.
24 See that my path is not wicked,
and lead me in the way everlasting.
