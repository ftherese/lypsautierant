Psalm 88

2 O Lord and God of my salvation,
I cry before you day and night.
3 Let my prayer come into your presence.
Incline your ear to my cry.
4 For my soul is filled with evils;
my life is on the brink of the grave.

5 I am reckoned as one in the tomb;
I am like a warrior without strength,
6 like one roaming among the dead,
like the slain lying in their graves,
like those you remember no more,
cut off, as they are, from your hand.

7 You have laid me in the depths of the pit,
in regions that are dark and deep.
8 Your anger weighs down upon me;
I am drowned beneath your waves.
9 You have taken away my friends;
to them you have made me hateful.

Imprisoned, I cannot escape;
10  my eyes are sunken with grief.
I call to you, Lord, all day long;
to you I stretch out my hands.

11 Will you work your wonders for the dead?
Will the shades rise up to praise you?
12 Will your mercy be told in the grave,
or your faithfulness in the place of perdition?
13 Will your wonders be known in the dark,
your justice in the land of oblivion?

14 But I, O Lord, cry out to you;
in the morning my prayer comes before you.
15 Why do you reject me, O Lord?
Why do you hide your face from me?

16 I am wretched, close to death from my youth.
I have borne your trials; I am numb.
17 Your fury has swept down upon me;
your terrors have utterly destroyed me.

18 They surround me all the day like a flood;
together they close in against me.
19 Friend and neighbor you have taken away:
my one companion is darkness.

Now and forever. Amen.
