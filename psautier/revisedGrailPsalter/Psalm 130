Psalm 130

1 Out of the dépths I crý to you, O LÓRD;
2 LÓRD, hear my vóice!
O lét your éars be atténtive
to the sóund of my pléadings.

3 If you, O LÓRD, should márk iníquities,
LÓRD, who could stánd?
4 But with yóu is fóund forgíveness,
that yóu may be revéred.

5 I lóng for yóu, O LÓRD,
my soul lóngs for his wórd.
6 My sóul hópes in the LÓRD
more than wátchmen for dáybreak.

Móre than wátchmen for dáybreak,
7 let Ísrael hópe for the LÓRD.
For with the LÓRD there is mércy,
in hím is pléntiful redémption.
8 It is hé who will redéem Ísrael
from áll its iníquities.
