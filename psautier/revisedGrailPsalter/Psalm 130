Psalm 130

1 Out of the depths I cry to you, O LORD;
2 LORD, hear my voice!
O let your ears be attentive
to the sound of my pleadings.

3 If you, O LORD, should mark iniquities,
LORD, who could stand?
4 But with you is found forgiveness,
that you may be revered.

5 I long for you, O LORD,
my soul longs for his word.
6 My soul hopes in the LORD
more than watchmen for daybreak.

More than watchmen for daybreak,
7 let Israel hope for the LORD.
For with the LORD there is mercy,
in him is plentiful redemption.
8 It is he who will redeem Israel
from all its iniquities.
