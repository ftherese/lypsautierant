Psalm 13

2 How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?
How long will you hide your face from me?
3 How long must I bear grief in my soul,
have sorrow in my heart all day long?
How long shall my enemy prevail over me?

4 Look, answer me, Lord my God!
Give light to my eyes lest I fall asleep in death;
5 lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him”;
lest my foes rejoice when they see me fall.

6 As for me, I trust in your merciful love.
Let my heart rejoice in your salvation.
7 I will sing to the Lord who has been bountiful with me.
I will sing psalms to the name of the Lord Most High.

Now and forever. Amen.
