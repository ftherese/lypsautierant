Psalm 147B

12 O Jerúsalem, glórify the LÓRD!
O Síon, práise your Gód!
13 He has stréngthened the bárs of your gátes;
he has bléssed your chíldren withín you.
14 He estáblished péace on your bórders;
he gíves you your fíll of finest whéat.

15 He sénds out his wórd to the éarth,
and swíftly rúns his commánd.
16 He shówers down snów like wóol;
he scátters hóarfrost like áshes.

17 He húrls down háilstones like crúmbs;
befóre such cóld, who can stánd?
18 He sénds forth his wórd and it mélts them;
at the blówing of his bréath the waters flów.

19 He revéals his wórd to Jácob;
to Ísrael, his decrées and júdgments.
20 He has nót dealt thús with other nátions;
he hás not táught them his júdgments.

Alleluia!
