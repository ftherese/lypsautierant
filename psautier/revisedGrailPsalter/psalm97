Psalm 97

1 The Lord is king, let earth rejoice;
let the many islands be glad.
2 Cloud and darkness surround him;
justice and right are the foundation of his throne.

3 A fire prepares his path;
it burns up his foes on every side.
4 His lightnings light up the world;
the earth looks on and trembles.

5 The mountains melt like wax 
before the face of the Lord,
before the face of the Lord of all the earth.
6 The skies proclaim his justice;
all peoples see his glory.

7 Let those who serve idols be ashamed,
those who boast of their worthless gods.
All you angels, worship him.
8 Sion hears and is glad;
the daughters of Judah rejoice
because of your judgments, O Lord.

9 For you indeed are the Lord,
most high above all the earth,
exalted far above all gods.

10 The Lord loves those who hate evil;
he guards the souls of his faithful;
he sets them free from the wicked.

11 Light shines forth for the just one,
and joy for the upright of heart.
12 Rejoice in the Lord, you just;
to the memory of his holiness give thanks.

Now and forever. Amen.
