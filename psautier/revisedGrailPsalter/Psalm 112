Psalm 112

1 Alleluia!

Bléssed the mán who fears the Lórd,
who tákes great delíght in his commándments.
2 His descéndants shall be pówerful on éarth;
the generátion of the úpright will be blést.

3 Ríches and wéalth are in his hóuse;
his jústice stands fírm foréver.
4 A light ríses in the dárkness for the úpright;
he is génerous, mérciful, and júst.

5 It goes wéll for the mán who deals génerously and lénds,
who condúcts his affáirs with jústice.
6 Hé will néver be móved;
foréver shall the júst be remémbered.

7 He hás no féar of evil néws;
with a firm héart, he trústs in the Lórd.
8 With a stéadfast héart he will not féar;
he will sée the dównfall of his fóes.

9 Open-hánded, he gíves to the póor;
his jústice stands fírm foréver.
His míght shall be exálted in glóry.

10 The wícked sées and is ángry,
grínds his téeth and fádes awáy;
the desíre of the wícked leads to dóom.
