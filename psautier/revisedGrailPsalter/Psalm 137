Psalm 137

1 By the rívers of Bábylon
thére we sat and wépt,
remémbering Síon;
2 on the póplars that gréw there
we húng up our hárps.

3 For it was thére that they ásked us,
our captors, for sóngs,
our oppréssors, for jóy.
``Síng to us," they sáid,
``one of Síon’s sóngs."

4 O hów could we síng
the sóng of the LÓRD
on fóreign sóil?
5 If I forgét you, Jerúsalem,
let my ríght hand wíther!

6 O lét my tóngue
cléave to my pálate
if I remémber you nót,
if I príze not Jerúsalem
as the fírst of my jóys!

7 Remémber, O LÓRD,
against the chíldren of Édom
the dáy of Jerúsalem,
when they sáid, ``Tear it dówn!
Tear it dówn to its foundátions!"

8 O dáughter Bábylon, destróyer,
bléssed whoéver repáys you
the páyment you páid to ús!
9 Blessed whoéver grásps and shátters
your chíldren on the róck!
