Psalm 91

1 He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High,
and abides in the shade of the Almighty,
2 says to the Lord, ``My refuge,
my stronghold, my God in whom I trust!"

3 He will free you from the snare of the fowler,
from the destructive plague;
4 he will conceal you with his pinions,
and under his wings you will find refuge.
His faithfulness is buckler and shield.

5 You will not fear the terror of the night,
nor the arrow that flies by day,
6 nor the plague that prowls in the darkness,
nor the scourge that lays waste at noon.

7 A thousand may fall at your side,
ten thousand fall at your right:
you it will never approach.

8 Your eyes have only to look
to see how the wicked are repaid.
9 For you, O Lord, are my refuge.
You have made the Most High your dwelling.

10 Upon you no evil shall fall,
no plague approach your tent.
11 For you has he commanded his angels
to keep you in all your ways.

12 They shall bear you upon their hands,
lest you strike your foot against a stone.
13 On the lion and the viper you will tread,
and trample the young lion and the serpent.

14 Since he clings to me in love, I will free him,
protect him, for he knows my name.
15 When he calls on me, I will answer him;
I will be with him in distress;
I will deliver him, and give him glory.

16 With length of days I will content him;
I will show him my saving power.
