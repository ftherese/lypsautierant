Psalm 91

1 He who dwélls in the shélter of the Most Hígh,
and abídes in the sháde of the Almíghty,
2 sáys to the Lórd, ``My réfuge,
my strónghold, my Gód in whom I trúst!"

3 He will frée you from the snáre of the fówler,
from the destrúctive plágue;
4 hé will concéal you with his pínions,
and únder his wíngs you will find réfuge.
His fáithfulness is búckler and shíeld.

5 You will not féar the térror of the níght,
nor the árrow that flíes by dáy,
6 nor the plágue that prówls in the dárkness,
nor the scóurge that lays wáste at nóon.

7 A thóusand may fáll at your síde,
ten thóusand fáll at your ríght:
yóu it will néver appróach.

8 Your éyes have ónly to lóok
to sée how the wícked are repáid.
9 For yóu, O Lórd, are my réfuge.
You have máde the Most Hígh your dwélling.

10 Upon yóu no évil shall fáll,
no plágue appróach your tént.
11 For yóu has he commánded his ángels
to kéep you in áll your wáys.

12 They shall béar you upón their hánds,
lest you stríke your fóot against a stóne.
13 On the líon and the víper you will tréad,
and trámple the young líon and the sérpent.

14 Since he clíngs to me in lóve, I will frée him,
protéct him, for he knóws my náme.
15 When he cálls on mé, I will ánswer him;
I will bé with hím in distréss;
I will delíver him, and gíve him glóry.

16 With léngth of dáys I will contént him;
I will shów him my sáving pówer.
