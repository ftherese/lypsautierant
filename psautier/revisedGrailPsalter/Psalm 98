Psalm 98

1 O síng a new sóng to the Lórd,
for hé has worked wónders.
His right hánd and his hóly árm
have bróught salvátion.

2 The Lórd has made knówn his salvátion,
has shówn his delíverance to the nátions.
3 He has remémbered his mérciful lóve
and his trúth for the hóuse of Ísrael.

All the énds of the éarth have séen
the salvátion of our Gód.
4 Shóut to the Lórd, all the éarth;
break fórth into jóyous sóng,
and síng out your práise.

5 Sing psálms to the Lórd with the hárp,
with the hárp and the sóund of sóng.
6 With trúmpets and the sóund of the hórn,
raise a shóut before the Kíng, the Lórd.

7 Let the séa and all withín it thúnder;
the wórld, and thóse who dwéll in it.
8 Let the rívers cláp their hánds,
and the hílls ring out their jóy
9 at the présence of the Lórd, for he cómes,
he comes to júdge the éarth.

He will júdge the wórld with jústice,
and the péoples with fáirness.
