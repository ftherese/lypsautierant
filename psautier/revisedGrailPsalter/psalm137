Psalm 119:136-144

137 You are just, O Lord;
your judgments are upright.
138 You have imposed your decrees with justice,
and with utter fidelity.

139 I am consumed with zeal,
for my foes forget your word.
140 Your promise has been thoroughly tested,
and it is cherished by your servant.

141 Although I am young and despised,
I do not forget your precepts.
142 Your justice is justice forever,
and your law is truth.

143 Though anguish and distress have found me,
your commands are my delight.
144 Your decrees are forever just;
give me insight, and I shall live.

Now and forever. Amen.
