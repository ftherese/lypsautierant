Psalm 86

1 Turn your éar, O Lórd, and ánswer me,
for Í am póor and néedy.
2 Presérve my sóul, for I am fáithful;
save the sérvant who trústs in you, my Gód.

3 Have mércy on mé, O Lórd,
for I crý to you áll the day lóng.
4 Gládden the sóul of your sérvant,
for I líft up my sóul to you, O Lórd.

5 O Lórd, you are góod and forgíving,
full of mércy to áll who call to yóu.
6 Give éar, O Lórd, to my práyer,
and atténd to my vóice in supplicátion.

7 In the dáy of distréss, I will cáll to you,
and súrely yóu will ánswer me.
8 Among the góds there is nóne like you, O Lórd,
nor wórks to compáre with yóurs.

9 All the nátions you have máde shall cóme;
they will bow dówn befóre you, O Lórd,
and glórify your náme,
10 for you are gréat and do márvelous déeds,
yóu who alóne are Gód.

11 Téach me, O Lórd, your wáy,
so that Í may wálk in your trúth,
single-héarted to féar your náme.

12 I will práise you, Lord my Gód, with all my héart,
and glórify your náme foréver.
13 Your mércy to mé has been gréat;
you have sáved me from the dépths of the gráve.

14 The proud have rísen agáinst me, O Gód;
a bánd of the rúthless seeks my lífe.
To yóu they páy no héed.

15 But you, O Gód, are compássionate and grácious,
slów to ánger, O Lórd,
abúndant in mércy and fidélity;
16 túrn and take píty on mé.

O gíve your stréngth to your sérvant,
and sáve the són of your hándmaid.
17 Shów me the sígn of your fávor,
that my fóes may sée to their sháme
that you, O Lórd, give me cómfort and hélp.
