Psalm 35

1 Conténd, O Lórd, with my conténders;
fíght those who fíght me.
2 Táke up your búckler and shíeld;
aríse in my defénse.

3 Táke up the jávelin and the spéar
against thóse who pursúe me.
Say to my sóul, ``Í am your salvátion."

4 Let thóse who séek my lífe
be shámed and disgráced.
Let thóse who plan évil agáinst me
be róuted in confúsion.

5 Let them bé like cháff before the wínd;
let the Lord’s ángel trip them úp.
6 Let their páth be slíppery and dárk;
let the Lord’s ángel pursúe them.

7 Unprovóked, they have hídden a nét for me;
they have dúg a pit for mé.
8 Let rúin fall upón them,
and táke them by surpríse.
Let them be cáught in the nét they have hídden;
let them fáll in their own pít.

9 Then my sóul shall rejóice in the Lórd,
and exúlt in his salvátion.
10 Áll my bónes will sáy,
``Lord, whó is like yóu
who réscue the wéak from the stróng
and the póor from the oppréssor?"

11 Lýing wítnesses aríse,
asking me quéstions I cánnot understánd.
12 They repáy me évil for góod;
my sóul is forlórn.

13 When they were síck I dréssed in sáckcloth,
afflícted my sóul with fásting,
and with práyer ever anéw in my héart,
14 as for a bróther, a fríend.
I wént as though móurning a móther,
bowed dówn with gríef.

15 Now that I stúmble, they gládly gáther;
they gáther, and móck me.
Í mysélf do not knów them,
yet strangers téar at me céaselessly.
16 They provóke me with móckery on móckery,
and gnásh their téeth at me.

17 O Lórd, how lóng will you look ón?
Réscue my lífe from their rávages,
my sóul from these líons.
18 Then I will thánk you in the gréat assémbly;
amid the míghty thróng I will práise you.

19 Do not lét my lýing fóes
rejóice over mé.
Do not lét those who háte me without cáuse
wink éyes at each óther.

20  They spéak no péace to the quíet ones
who líve in the lánd.
Rather, they máke decéitful plóts,
21 and, with móuths wide ópen,
they útter their crý agáinst me:
 ``Yes, yes! Our éyes have séen it!"

22 O Lórd, you have séen; do not be sílent;
Lórd, do not stánd afar óff!
23 Awáke! And stír to my defénse, 
to my cáuse, O my Gód and my Lórd!

24 Víndicate me, Lórd, my Gód,
in accórd with your jústice;
and lét them not rejóice over mé.

25 Dó not let them thínk in their héarts,
``Yés, we have wón."
Dó not lét them sáy,
``Wé have destróyed him!"

26 Let them be shámed and bróught to disgráce
who rejóice at my misfórtune.
Let them be cóvered with sháme and confúsion
who ráise themselves agáinst me.

27 Lét them exúlt and be glád
who delíght in my delíverance.
Lét them sáy without énd,
``Gréat is the Lórd who delíghts
in the péace of his sérvant."

28 Then my tóngue shall spéak of your jústice,
and all day lóng of your práise.
