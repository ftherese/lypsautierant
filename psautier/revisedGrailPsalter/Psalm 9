Psalm 9

2 I will práise you, Lórd, with all my héart;
all your wónders Í will conféss.
3 I will rejóice in yóu and be glád,
and sing psálms to your náme, O Most Hígh.

4 Sée how my énemies turn báck,
how they stúmble and pérish befóre you.
5 You uphéld the jústice of my cáuse;
you sat enthróned, an úpright júdge.

6 You have rebúked the nátions, destróyed the wícked;
you have wíped out their náme foréver and éver.
7 The fóe is destróyed, etérnally rúined.
You upróoted their cíties; their mémory has pérished.

8 But the Lórd sits enthróned foréver;
he has sét up his thróne for júdgment.
9 He will júdge the wórld with ríghteousness;
he will góvern the péoples with équity.

10 For the oppréssed, the Lórd will be a strónghold,
a strónghold in tímes of distréss.
11 Those who knów your náme will trúst you;
you will not forsáke those who séek you, O Lórd.

12 Sing psálms to the Lórd who dwells in Síon.
Téll his mighty wórks among the péoples,
13 for the Avénger of Blóod has remémbered them,
has not forgótten the crý of the póor.

14 Have mércy on mé, O Lórd;
sée how I súffer from my fóes,
you who ráise me from the gátes of déath,
15 that Í may recóunt all your práise
at the gátes of dáughter Síon,
and rejóice in yóur salvátion.

16 The nátions have fállen in the pít which they máde;
their féet have been cáught in the snáre they láid.
17 The Lórd has revéaled himself; hé has given júdgment.
The wícked are snáred by the wórk of their hánds.

18 Let the wícked go dówn to the gráve,
all the nátions forgétful of Gód:
19 for the néedy shall not álways be forgótten,
nor the hópes of the póor ever pérish.

20 Arise, O Lórd, let human stréngth not preváil!
Let the nátions be júdged befóre you.
21 Stríke them with térror, O Lórd;
let the nátions knów they are but mén.
