Psalm 59

2 Rescue me from my foes, O God;
protect me from those who attack me.
3 O rescue me from those who do evil,
and save me from bloodthirsty men.

4 See, they lie in wait for my life;
the strong band together against me.
For no offense, no sin of mine, O Lord,
5 for no guilt of mine they rush to take their stand.

Awake! Come to meet me, and see!
6 Lord God of hosts, you are Israel’s God.
Rouse yourself and punish the nations;
show no mercy to evil traitors.
7 Each evening they come back;
howling like dogs, they roam about the city.

8 See how their mouths utter insults;
their lips are like sharpened swords.
“For who,” they say, “will hear us?”
9 But you, Lord, will laugh them to scorn.
You make a mockery of all the nations.

10 O my Strength, for you will I watch,
for you, O God, are my stronghold,
11 the God who shows me merciful love.

Now God will proceed before me;
God will let me look upon my foes.
12 Do not kill them lest my people forget;
rout them by your power, lay them low.

It is you, Lord God, who are our shield.
13 For the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips,
let them be caught in their pride;
for the curses and lies that they speak.

14 Destroy them in your anger. Destroy them
till they are no more.
Let them know that God is the ruler
over Jacob and the ends of the earth.

15 Each evening they come back;
they howl like dogs and roam about the city.
16 They prowl in search of food;
they growl till they have their fill.

17 As for me, I will sing of your strength,
and acclaim your mercy in the morning,
for you have been my stronghold,
a refuge in the day of my distress.

18 O my Strength, to you I will sing praise,
for you, O God, are my stronghold,
the God who shows me merciful love.

Now and forever. Amen.
