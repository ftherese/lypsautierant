Psalm 45

2 My heart overflows with noble words.
To the king I address the song I have made,
my tongue as nimble as the pen of a scribe.

3 You are the most handsome of the sons of men,
and graciousness is poured out upon your lips,
for God has blessed you forevermore.

4 Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one,
with your splendor and your majesty.
5 In your majesty ride on triumphant
in the cause of truth, meekness, and justice.
May your right hand show your wondrous deeds.

6 Your arrows are sharp—peoples fall beneath you—
in the heart of the foes of the king.

7 Your throne, O God, shall endure forever.
A scepter of justice is the scepter of your kingdom.
8 Your love is for justice; your hatred for evil.

Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
with the oil of gladness above other kings:
9 your robes are fragrant with aloes, myrrh, and cassia.
From the ivory palace you are gladdened with music.

10 The daughters of kings are those whom you favor.
On your right stands the queen in gold of Ophir.

11 Listen, O daughter; pay heed and give ear:
forget your own people and your father’s house.
12 So will the king desire your beauty.
He is your Lord, pay homage to him.

13 And the daughter of Tyre shall come with gifts;
the richest of the people shall seek your favor.
14 The daughter of the king is clothed with splendor;
her robes are threaded with gold.

15 In fine clothing she is led to the king;
behind her are her maiden companions, brought to you.
16 They are escorted amid gladness and joy;
they pass within the palace of the king.

17 Sons will be yours to succeed your fathers;
you will make them rulers over all the earth.
18 I will make your name forever remembered.
Thus the peoples will praise you from age to age.

Now and forever. Amen.
