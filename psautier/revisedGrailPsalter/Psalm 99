Psalm 99

1 The Lord is kíng; the péoples trémble.
He is enthróned on the chérubim; earth quákes.
2 The Lórd is gréat in Síon.
He is exálted over áll the péoples.

3 Let them práise your gréat and awesome náme.
Hóly ís hé!
4 O mighty Kíng, lóver of jústice,
you have estáblished whát is úpright;
you have made jústice and ríght in Jácob.

5 Exált the Lórd our Gód;
bow dówn befóre his fóotstool.
Hóly ís hé!

6 Amóng his príests were Áaron and Móses;
among thóse who invóked his náme was Sámuel.
They cried óut to the Lórd and he ánswered.

7 To them he spóke in the píllar of clóud.
They obéyed his decrées and the státutes
which hé had gíven thém.

8 O Lórd our Gód, you ánswered them.
For thém you were a Gód who forgíves,
and yét you púnished their offénses.

9 Exált the Lórd our Gód;
bow dówn before his hóly móuntain,
for the Lórd our Gód is hóly.
