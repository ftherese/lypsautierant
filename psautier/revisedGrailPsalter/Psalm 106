Psalm 106

1 Alleluia!

O give thánks to the Lórd, for he is góod;
for his mércy endúres foréver.
2 Who can téll the Lórd’s mighty déeds,
or recóunt in fúll his práise?

3 Blessed are théy who obsérve what is júst,
who at áll times dó what is ríght.
4 O Lórd, remémber mé
with the fávor you shów to your péople.

Visit mé with your sáving pówer,
5 that I may sée the ríches of your chósen ones,
and may rejóice in the gládness of your nátion,
bóasting in the glóry of your héritage.

6 Like our fáthers, wé have sínned.
We have done wróng; our déeds have been évil.
7 Our fórebears, when théy were in Égypt,
did not grásp the méaning of your wónders.

They forgót the great númber of your mércies,
at the Réd Sea defíed the Most Hígh.
8 Yet he sáved them for the sáke of his náme,
in órder to make knówn his pówer.

9 He rebúked the Red Séa; it dried úp,
and he léd them through the déep as through the désert.
10 He sáved them from the hánd of the fóe;
he fréed them from the gríp of the énemy.

11 The wáters cóvered their oppréssors;
not óne of thém was léft.
12 Thén they belíeved in his wórds;
thén they sáng his práises.

13 But they sóon forgót his déeds,
and wóuld not wáit upon his cóunsel.
14 They yíelded to their crávings in the désert,
and put Gód to the tést in the wílderness.

15 He gránted them the fávor they ásked,
but strúck them with a wásting diséase.
16 In the cámp, they were jéalous of Móses,
and also Áaron, who was hóly to the Lórd.

17 The earth ópened and swállowed up Dáthan,
and búried the clán of Abíram.
18 Fíre blazed úp against their clán,
and flámes devóured the wícked.

19 They fáshioned a cálf at Hóreb,
and wórshiped an ímage of métal;
20  théy exchánged their glóry
for the ímage of a búll that eats gráss.

21 They forgót the Gód who was their sávior,
who had dóne such gréat things in Égypt,
22 such wónders in the lánd of Hám,
such márvels at the Réd Séa.

23 For thís he sáid he would destróy them,
but Móses, the mán he had chósen,
stóod in the bréach befóre him,
to túrn back his ánger from destrúction.

24 Then they scórned the desírable lánd;
they hád no fáith in his wórd.
25 They compláined insíde their ténts,
and did not lísten to the vóice of the Lórd.

26 So he ráised his hánd to them and swóre
that he would láy them lów in the désert,
27 would dispérse their descéndants through the nátions
and scátter them throughóut the lánds.

28 They bówed before the Báal of Péor,
ate ófferings made to lífeless góds.
29 They róused the Lord to ánger with their déeds,
and a plágue broke óut amóng them.

30  Then Phínehas stood úp and intervéned.
Thús the plágue was énded,
31 and this was cóunted to hím as ríghteous
from áge to áge foréver.

32 They provóked him at the wáters of Méribah.
Through their fáult it went íll with Móses,
33 for they máde his spírit grow bítter,
and he úttered wórds that were rásh.

34 They fáiled to destróy the péoples,
as the Lórd had commánded thém;
35 instéad they míngled with the nátions,
and léarned to áct as théy did.

36 They álso sérved their ídols,
and thése became a snáre to entráp them.
37 They éven óffered their sóns
and their dáughters in sácrifice to démons.

38 They póured out ínnocent blóod,
the blóod of their sóns and dáughters,
whom they óffered to the ídols of Cánaan.
The lánd was pollúted with blóod.

39 So they defíled themsélves by their áctions;
their déeds were thóse of a hárlot.
40  Then God’s ánger blázed against his péople;
he was fílled with hórror at his héritage.

41 So he hánded them óver to the nátions,
and their fóes becáme their rúlers.
42 Their énemies álso oppréssed them;
they were subdúed benéath their hánd.

43 Tíme after tíme he réscued them,
but in their málice they dáred to defý him
and were wéakened even móre by their guílt.
44 In spite of thís he paid héed to their distréss,
so óften as he héard their crý.

45 For their sáke he remémbered his cóvenant.
In the gréatness of his mércy, he relénted,
46 and he lét them be tréated with compássion
by áll who héld them cáptive.

47 Sáve us, O Lórd our Gód!
And gáther ús from the nátions,
to give thánks to your hóly náme,
and máke it our glóry to práise you.

[48] Blést be the Lórd, God of Ísrael,
foréver, from áge to áge.
Let áll the péople sáy,
``Amén! Amén! Allelúia!"
