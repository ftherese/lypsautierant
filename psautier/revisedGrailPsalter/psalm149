Psalm 127

1 If the Lord does not build the house,
in vain do its builders labor;
if the Lord does not guard the city,
in vain does the guard keep watch.

2 In vain is your earlier rising,
your going later to rest,
you who toil for the bread you eat,
when he pours gifts on his beloved while they slumber.

3 Yes, children are a gift from the Lord,
a blessing, the fruit of the womb.
4 Indeed, the sons of youth
are like arrows in the hand of a warrior.

5 Blessed is the warrior
who has filled his quiver with these arrows!
He will have no cause for shame,
when he disputes with his foes in the gateways.

Now and forever. Amen.
