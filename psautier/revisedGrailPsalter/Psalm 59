Psalm 59

2 Réscue me from my fóes, O Gód;
protéct me from thóse who attáck me.
3 O réscue me from thóse who do évil,
and sáve me from blóodthirsty mén.

4 See, they líe in wáit for my lífe;
the stróng band togéther agáinst me.
For no offénse, no sín of mine, O Lórd,
5 for no guílt of mine they rúsh to take their stánd.

Awáke! Come to méet me, and sée!
6 Lord God of hósts, you are Ísrael’s Gód.
Róuse yourself and púnish the nátions;
show no mércy to évil tráitors.
7 Each évening théy come báck;
howling like dógs, they róam about the cíty.

8 Sée how their móuths utter ínsults;
their líps are like shárpened swórds.
``For whó," they sáy, ``will héar us?"
9 But yóu, Lord, will láugh them to scórn.
You make a móckery of áll the nátions.

10 O my Stréngth, for yóu will I wátch,
for yóu, O Gód, are my strónghold,
11 the God who shóws me mérciful lóve.

Now Gód will procéed befóre me;
Gód will let me lóok upon my fóes.
12 Do not kíll them lest my péople forgét;
róut them by your pówer, lay them lów.

It is yóu, Lord Gód, who are our shíeld.
13 For the síns of their móuths and the wórds of their líps,
lét them be cáught in their príde;
for the cúrses and líes that they spéak.

14 Destróy them in your ánger. Destróy them
till they áre no móre.
Let them knów that Gód is the rúler
over Jácob and the énds of the éarth.

15 Each évening théy come báck;
they howl like dógs and róam about the cíty.
16 They prówl in séarch of fóod;
they grówl till they háve their fíll.

17 As for mé, I will síng of your stréngth,
and accláim your mércy in the mórning,
for yóu have béen my strónghold,
a réfuge in the dáy of my distréss.

18 O my Stréngth, to yóu I will sing práise,
for yóu, O Gód, are my strónghold,
the God who shóws me mérciful lóve.
