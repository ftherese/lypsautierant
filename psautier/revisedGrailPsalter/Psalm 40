Psalm 40

2 I waited, I waited for the Lord,
and he stooped down to me;
he heard my cry.

3 He drew me from the deadly pit,
from the miry clay.
He set my feet upon a rock,
made my footsteps firm.

4 He put a new song into my mouth,
praise of our God.
Many shall see and fear
and shall trust in the Lord.

5 Blessed the man who has placed
his trust in the Lord,
and has not gone over to the proud
who follow false gods.

6 How many, O Lord my God,
are the wonders and designs
that you have worked for us;
you have no equal.
Should I wish to proclaim or speak of them,
they would be more than I can tell!

7 You delight not in sacrifice and offerings,
but in an open ear.
You do not ask for holocaust and victim.

8 Then I said, ``See, I have come."
In the scroll of the book it stands written of me:
9 ``I delight to do your will, O my God;
your instruction lies deep within me."

10 Your justice I have proclaimed
in the great assembly.
My lips I have not sealed;
you know it, O Lord.

11 Your saving help I have not hidden in my heart;
of your faithfulness and salvation I have spoken.
I made no secret of your merciful love
and your faithfulness to the great assembly.

12 O Lord, you will not withhold
your compassion from me.
Your merciful love and your faithfulness 
will always guard me.

13 For I am beset with evils
too many to be counted.
My iniquities have overtaken me,
till I can see no more.
They are more than the hairs of my head,
and my heart is sinking.

14 Be pleased, O Lord, to rescue me;
Lord, make haste to help me.
15 O let there be shame and confusion
on those who seek my life.

O let them turn back in confusion
who delight in my harm.
16 Let them be appalled because of their shame,
those who jeer and mock me.

17 O let there be rejoicing and gladness
for all who seek you.
Let them ever say, ``The Lord is great,"
who long for your salvation.

18 Wretched and poor though I am,
the Lord is mindful of me.
You are my rescuer, my help;
O my God, do not delay.
