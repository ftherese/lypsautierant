Psalm 42

2 Líke the déer that yéarns
for rúnning stréams,
só my sóul is yéarning
for yóu, my Gód.

3 My sóul is thírsting for Gód,
the líving Gód;
whén can I énter and appéar
before the fáce of Gód?

4 My téars have becóme my bréad,
by dáy, by níght,
as they sáy to me áll the day lóng,
``Whére is your Gód?"

5 These thíngs will Í remémber
as I póur out my sóul:
For Í would gó to the pláce 
of your wóndrous tént,
all the wáy to the hóuse of Gód,
amid críes of gládness and thanksgíving,
the thróng keeping jóyful féstival.

6 Why are you cast dówn, my sóul;
why gróan withín me?
Hope in Gód; I will práise him yet agáin,
my saving présence and my Gód.

7 My sóul is cast dówn withín me,
thérefore I remémber you 
from the lánd of Jórdan and Mount Hérmon,
from the Híll of Mízar.

8 Déep is cálling on déep,
in the róar of your tórrents;
your bíllows and áll your wáves
swépt over mé.

9 By dáy the Lórd decrées
his mérciful lóve;
by níght his sóng is with mé,
prayer to the Gód of my lífe.

10 I will sáy to Gód, my róck,
``Whý have you forgótten me?
Whý do Í go móurning
oppréssed by the fóe?"

11 With a déadly wóund in my bónes,
my énemies revíle me,
sáying to me áll the day lóng,
``Whére is your Gód?"

12 Whý are you cast dówn, my sóul;
why gróan withín me?
Hope in Gód; I will práise him yet agáin,
my saving présence and my Gód.
