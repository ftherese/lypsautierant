Psalm 28

1 To you, O Lord, I call;
my rock, be not deaf to me.
I shall go down to those in the pit,
if you are silent to me.

2 Hear the voice of my pleading
as I call to you for help,
as I raise my hands
toward your holy place.

3 Do not drag me away with the wicked,
with those who do evil,
who speak words of peace to their neighbors,
but with malice in their hearts.

4 Repay them according to their deeds,
according to the evil of their actions.
According to their handiwork, repay them;
return to them their deserts.

5 For they ignore the deeds of the Lord
and the work of his hands.
May he ruin them and never rebuild them.
6 Blest be the Lord, for he has heard
the sound of my appeal.

7 The Lord is my strength and my shield;
in him my heart trusts.
I was helped; my heart rejoices,
and I praise him with my song.

8 The Lord is the strength of his people,
a saving refuge for his anointed.
9 Save your people and bless your heritage.
Shepherd them and carry them forever.

Now and forever. Amen.
