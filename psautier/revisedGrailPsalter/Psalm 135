Psalm 135

1 Práise the náme of the LÓRD;
práise him, sérvants of the LÓRD,
2 who stánd in the hóuse of the LÓRD,
in the cóurts of the hóuse of our Gód.

3 Praise the LÓRD, for the LÓRD is góod.
Sing a psálm to his náme, for this is our delíght.
4 For the LÓRD has chosen Jácob for himsélf,
and Ísrael as his tréasured posséssion.

5 For I knów that the LÓRD is gréat,
that our LÓRD is hígh above all góds.
6 The LORD dóes whatéver he wílls,
in héaven, ánd on éarth,
in the séas, and in áll the dépths.

7 He summons clóuds from the énds of the éarth,
makes líghtning prodúce the ráin;
from his tréasuries he sénds forth the wínd.

8 The firstbórn of the Egýptians he smóte,
of mán and béast alíke.
9 He sent sígns and wónders in your mídst, O Égypt,
against Pháraoh and áll his sérvants.
10 Nátions in great númbers he strúck,
and kíngs in their míght he sléw:

11 Síhon, kíng of the Ámorites,
Óg, the kíng of Báshan,
and áll the kíngdoms of Cánaan.
12 Their lánd he gáve as a héritage,
a héritage to Ísrael, his péople.

13 LÓRD, your náme stands foréver,
your renówn, LORD, from áge to áge.
14 For the LÓRD does jústice for his péople
and takes píty on his sérvants.

15 Pagan ídols are sílver and góld,
the wórk of húman hánds.
16 They have móuths but they dó not spéak;
they have éyes but they dó not sée.

17 They have éars but they dó not héar;
there is néver a bréath on their líps.
18 Their mákers will cóme to be like thém,
and só will áll who trúst in them!

19 House of Ísrael, bléss the LÓRD!
House of Áaron, bléss the LÓRD!
20 House of Lévi, bléss the LÓRD!
You who féar the LORD, bléss the LÓRD!
21 From Síon may the LÓRD be blést,
hé who dwélls in Jerúsalem!

Alleluia!
