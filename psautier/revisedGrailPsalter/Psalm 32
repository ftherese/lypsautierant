Psalm 32

1 Blessed is hé whose transgréssion is forgíven,
whose sín is remítted.
2 Blessed the mán to whom the Lórd imputes no guílt,
in whose spírit is no guíle.

3 I kept it sécret and my fráme was wásted.
I gróaned all day lóng,
4 for your hánd, by dáy and by níght,
lay héavy upón me.
Indéed, my stréngth was dried úp
as by the súmmer’s héat.

5 To yóu I have acknówledged my sín;
my guílt I did not híde.
I sáid, ``I will conféss my transgréssion to the Lórd."
And yóu have forgíven the guílt of my sín.

6 So let each fáithful one práy to yóu
in the tíme of néed.
The flóods of wáter may reach hígh,
but such a óne they shall not réach.

7 Yóu are a híding place for mé;
you kéep me sáfe from distréss;
you surróund me with críes of delíverance.

8 Í will instrúct you and téach you
the wáy you should gó;
I will fíx my éyes upón you.

9 Be not like hórse and múle, unintélligent,
needing brídle and bít,
or élse they will nót appróach you.

10 Mány sórrows has the wícked,
but lóving mércy surróunds
óne who trústs in the Lórd.

11 Rejóice in the Lórd; exult, you júst!
Ring out your jóy, all you úpright of héart!
