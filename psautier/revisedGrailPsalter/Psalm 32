Psalm 32

1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
whose sin is remitted.
2 Blessed the man to whom the Lord imputes no guilt,
in whose spirit is no guile.

3 I kept it secret and my frame was wasted.
I groaned all day long,
4 for your hand, by day and by night,
lay heavy upon me.
Indeed, my strength was dried up
as by the summerâ€™s heat.

5 To you I have acknowledged my sin;
my guilt I did not hide.
I said, ``I will confess my transgression to the Lord."
And you have forgiven the guilt of my sin.

6 So let each faithful one pray to you
in the time of need.
The floods of water may reach high,
but such a one they shall not reach.

7 You are a hiding place for me;
you keep me safe from distress;
you surround me with cries of deliverance.

8 I will instruct you and teach you
the way you should go;
I will fix my eyes upon you.

9 Be not like horse and mule, unintelligent,
needing bridle and bit,
or else they will not approach you.

10 Many sorrows has the wicked,
but loving mercy surrounds
one who trusts in the Lord.

11 Rejoice in the Lord; exult, you just!
Ring out your joy, all you upright of heart!
