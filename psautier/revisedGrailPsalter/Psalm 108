Psalm 108

2 My heart is ready, O God;
my heart is ready.
I will sing, I will sing your praise.
Awake, my soul; 
3 awake, O lyre and harp.
I will awake the dawn.

4 I will praise you, Lord, among the peoples;
I will sing psalms to you among the nations,
5 for your mercy reaches to the heavens,
and your truth to the skies.

6 O God, be exalted above the heavens;
may your glory shine on all the earth!
7 With your right hand, grant salvation and give answer;
O come and deliver your friends.

8 From his holy place God has made this promise:
``I will exult, and divide the land of Shechem;
I will measure out the valley of Succoth.

9 Gilead is mine, as is Manasseh;
Ephraim I take for my helmet,
Judah is my scepter.
10 Moab is my washbowl;
on Edom I will toss my shoe.
Over Philistia I will shout in triumph."

11 But who will lead me to the fortified city?
Who will bring me to Edom?
12 Have you not cast us off, O God?
Will you march with our armies no longer?

13 Give us rescue against the foe,
for human aid is vain.
14 With God, we shall do bravely,
and he will trample down our foes.
