Psalm 90

1 O Lord, you have been our refuge,
from generation to generation.
2 Before the mountains were born,
or the earth or the world were brought forth,
you are God, from age to age.

3 You turn man back to dust,
and say, “Return, O children of men.”
4 To your eyes a thousand years
are like yesterday, come and gone,
or like a watch in the night.

5 You sweep them away like a dream,
like grass which is fresh in the morning.
6 In the morning it sprouts and is fresh;
by evening it withers and fades.

7 Indeed, we are consumed by your anger;
we are struck with terror at your fury.
8 You have set our guilt before you,
our secrets in the light of your face.

9 All our days pass away in your anger.
Our years are consumed like a sigh.
10 Seventy years is the span of our days,
or eighty if we are strong.
And most of these are toil and pain.
They pass swiftly and we are gone.

11 Who understands the power of your anger?
Your fury matches the fear of you.
12 Then teach us to number our days,
that we may gain wisdom of heart.

13 Turn back, O Lord! How long?
Show pity to your servants.
14 At dawn, fill us with your merciful love;
we shall exult and rejoice all our days.
15 Give us joy for the days of our affliction,
for the years when we looked upon evil.

16 Let your deed be seen by your servants,
and your glorious power by their children.
17 Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us;
give success to the work of our hands.
O give success to the work of our hands.
