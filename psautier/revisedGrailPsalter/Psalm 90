Psalm 90

1 O Lórd, yóu have been our réfuge,
from generátion tó generátion.
2 Befóre the móuntains were bórn,
or the éarth or the wórld were brought fórth,
you are Gód, from áge to áge.

3 You túrn man báck to dúst,
and say, ``Retúrn, O chíldren of mén."
4 To your éyes a thóusand yéars
are like yésterday, cóme and góne,
or líke a wátch in the níght.

5 You swéep them awáy like a dréam,
like gráss which is frésh in the mórning.
6 In the mórning it spróuts and is frésh;
by évening it wíthers and fádes.

7 Indéed, we are consúmed by your ánger;
we are strúck with térror at your fúry.
8 You have sét our guílt befóre you,
our sécrets in the líght of your fáce.

9 All our dáys pass awáy in your ánger.
Our yéars are consúmed like a sígh.
10 Seventy yéars is the spán of our dáys,
or éighty if wé are stróng.
And móst of these are tóil and páin.
They pass swíftly and wé are góne.

11 Who understánds the pówer of your ánger?
Your fúry mátches the féar of you.
12 Then téach us to númber our dáys,
that wé may gain wísdom of héart.

13 Turn báck, O Lórd! How lóng?
Show píty tó your sérvants.
14 At dawn, fíll us with your mérciful lóve;
we shall exúlt and rejóice all our dáys.
15 Give us jóy for the dáys of our afflíction,
for the yéars when we lóoked upon évil.

16 Let your déed be séen by your sérvants,
and your glórious pówer by their chíldren.
17 Let the fávor of the Lórd our Gód be upón us;
give succéss to the wórk of our hánds.
O give succéss to the wórk of our hánds.
