Psalm 68

2 Let God arise; let his foes be scattered.
Let those who hate him flee from his presence.
3 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away;
like wax that melts before the fire,
so the wicked shall perish at the presence of God.

4 But the just shall rejoice at the presence of God;
they shall exult with glad rejoicing.
5 O sing to God; make music to his name.
Extol the One who rides on the clouds.
The Lord is his name; exult at his presence.

6 Father of orphans, defender of widows:
such is God in his holy place.
7 God gives the desolate a home to dwell in;
he leads the prisoners forth into prosperity,
but rebels must dwell in a parched land.

8 O God, when you went forth before your people,
when you marched out across the desert,
9 the earth trembled, heavens poured down rain:
at the face of God, the God of Sinai,
at the face of God, the God of Israel.

10 You poured down, O God, a generous rain;
when your people languished, you restored their inheritance.
11 It was there that your flock began to dwell.
In your goodness, O God, you provided for the poor.

12 The Lord announces the command;
a mighty throng bears good tidings:
13 ``The kings and armies are in headlong flight,
while you were at rest among the sheepfolds."

14 At home the women already share the spoil.
They are covered with silver as the wings of a dove,
its feathers brilliant with shining gold.
15 When the Almighty scatters kings on the mountain,
it is like snow whitening Mount Zalmon.

16 You, mountain of Bashan, are a mighty mountain;
a many-peaked mountain, the mountain of Bashan.
17 Why look with envy, you many-peaked mountain,
at the mountain where God has desired to dwell?
It is there that the Lord shall dwell forever.

18 The chariots of God are thousands upon thousands.
The Lord has come from Sinai to the holy place.
19 You have ascended on high; leading captivity captive
as tribute receiving prisoners, O God,
so that even rebels may dwell near the Lord God.

20  Day after day, may the Lord be blest.
He bears our burdens; God is our savior.
21 This God of ours is a God who saves.
The Lord our Lord provides an escape from death.
22 And God will smite the head of his foes,
the hairy crown of him who walks about in his guilt.

23 The Lord said, ``I will bring them back from Bashan;
I will bring them back from the depth of the sea.
24 Then you will bathe your feet in their blood,
and the tongues of your dogs take their share of the foe."

25 They see your solemn procession, O God,
the procession of my God, of my king, to the holy place:
26 the singers in the forefront, the musicians coming last;
between them, maidens sounding their timbrels.

27 ``In the sacred assembly, bless God, the Lord,
O you who are from the fountain of Israel."
28 There is Benjamin, least of the tribes, at the head;
Judah’s princes, a mighty throng;
Zebulun’s princes, Naphtali’s princes.

29 Summon forth your might, O God;
your might, O God, which you have shown for us.
30  From your temple high in Jerusalem,
kings will come to you bringing their tribute.

31 Rebuke the wild beast that dwells in the reeds,
the bands of the mighty and rulers of the peoples.
Scatter the peoples who delight in war.
32 Rich merchants will make their way from Egypt;
Ethiopia will stretch out her hands to God.

33 You kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, praise the Lord
34 who rides on the heavens, the ancient heavens.
Behold, he thunders his voice, his mighty voice.
35 Come, acknowledge the power of God.

His glory is on Israel; his might is in the skies.
36 Awesome is God in his holy place.
He is God, the God of Israel.
He himself gives strength and power to his people.
Blest be God!
