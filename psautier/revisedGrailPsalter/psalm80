Psalm 80

2 O shepherd of Israel, hear us,
you who lead Joseph like a flock:
enthroned on the cherubim, shine forth
3 upon Ephraim, Benjamin, Manasseh.
Rouse up your might and come to save us.

4 O God, bring us back;
let your face shine on us, and we shall be saved.

5 How long, O Lord, God of hosts,
will you be angry at the prayer of your people?
6 You have fed them with tears for their bread,
an abundance of tears for their drink.
7 You have made us the taunt of our neighbors;
our foes mock us among themselves.

8 O God of hosts, bring us back;
let your face shine forth, and we shall be saved.

9 You brought a vine out of Egypt;
you drove out the nations and planted it.
10 Before it you cleared the ground;
it took root and filled the land.

11 The mountains were covered with its shadow,
the cedars of God with its boughs.
12 It stretched out its branches to the sea;
to the River it stretched out its shoots.

13 Then why have you broken down its walls?
It is plucked by all who pass by the way.
14 It is ravaged by the boar of the forest,
devoured by the beasts of the field.

15 God of hosts, turn again, we implore;
look down from heaven and see.

Visit this vine and protect it,
16 the vine your right hand has planted,
the son of man you have claimed for yourself.
17 They have burnt it with fire and cut it down.
May they perish at the frown of your face.

18 May your hand be on the man at your right hand,
the son of man you have confirmed as your own.
19 And we shall never forsake you again;
give us life that we may call upon your name.

20  O Lord God of hosts, bring us back;
let your face shine forth, and we shall be saved.

Now and forever. Amen.
