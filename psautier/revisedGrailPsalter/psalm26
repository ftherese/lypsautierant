Psalm 26

1 Give judgment for me, O Lord,
for I have walked in my integrity.
I have trusted in the Lord; I have not wavered.

2 Examine me, Lord, and try me.
O test my heart and my mind.
3 Your mercy is before my eyes,
and I walk according to your truth.

4 I never take my seat with liars,
and with hypocrites I shall not go.
5 I hate the evildoerâ€™s company;
I will not take my seat with the wicked.

6 I wash my hands in innocence
and take my place around your altar,
7 singing a song of thanksgiving,
recounting all your wonders.
8 O Lord, I love the house where you dwell,
the place where your glory abides.

9 Do not sweep away my soul with sinners,
nor my life with those who shed blood,
10 in whose hands are evil plots,
whose right hands are filled with a bribe.

11 As for me, I have walked in my integrity.
Redeem me and have mercy on me.
12 My foot stands on level ground:
I will bless the Lord in the assembly.

Now and forever. Amen.
