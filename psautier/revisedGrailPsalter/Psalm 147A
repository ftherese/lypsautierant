Psalm 147A

1 Alleluia!

1 How good to sing psalms to our God;
how pleasant to chant fitting praise!

2 The LORD builds up Jerusalem
and brings back Israel’s exiles;
3 he heals the brokenhearted;
he binds up all their wounds.
4 He counts out the number of the stars;
he calls each one by its name.

5 Our LORD is great and almighty;
his wisdom can never be measured.
6 The LORD lifts up the lowly;
he casts down the wicked to the ground.
7 O sing to the LORD, giving thanks;
sing psalms to our God with the harp.

8 He covers the heavens with clouds;
he prepares the rain for the earth,
making mountains sprout with grass,
and plants to serve human needs.
9 He provides the cattle with their food,
and young ravens that call upon him.

10 His delight is not in horses,
nor his pleasure in a warrior’s strength.
11 The LORD delights in those who revere him,
those who wait for his merciful love.
