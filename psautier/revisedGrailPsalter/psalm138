Psalm 119:145-152

145 I call with all my heart; Lord, answer me.
I will observe your statutes.
146 I call upon you; save me,
and I will keep your decrees.

147 I rise before dawn and cry for help;
I have hoped in your word.
148 My eyes awaken before dawn,
to ponder your promise.

149 In your mercy, hear my voice, O Lord;
give me life by your decrees.
150 Those who pursue me with malice draw near;
they are far from your law.

151 But you, O Lord, are close;
all your commands are truth.
152 From of old I have known that your decrees
are established forever.

Now and forever. Amen.
