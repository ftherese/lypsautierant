Psalm 95

1 Come, let us ríng out our jóy to the Lórd;
háil the róck who sáves us.
2 Let us cóme into his présence, giving thánks;
let us háil him with a sóng of práise.

3 A míghty Gód is the Lórd,
a great kíng abóve all góds.
4 In his hánds are the dépths of the éarth;
the héights of the móuntains are hís.
5 To hím belongs the séa, for he máde it,
and the dry lánd that he sháped by his hánds.

6 O cóme; let us bów and bend lów.
Let us knéel before the Gód who máde us,
7 for hé is our Gód and wé
the péople who belóng to his pásture,
the flóck that is léd by his hánd.

O that todáy you would lísten to his vóice!
8 ``Hárden not your héarts as at Méribah,
as on that dáy at Mássah in the désert
9 when your fórebears pút me to the tést;
when they tríed me, though they sáw my wórk.

10 For forty yéars I wéaried of that generátion,
and I sáid, ‘Their héarts are astráy;
this péople does not knów my wáys.’
11 Thén I took an óath in my ánger,
‘Néver shall they énter my rést.’"
