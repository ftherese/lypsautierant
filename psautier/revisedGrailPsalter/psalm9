Psalm 9

2 I will praise you, Lord, with all my heart;
all your wonders I will confess.
3 I will rejoice in you and be glad,
and sing psalms to your name, O Most High.

4 See how my enemies turn back,
how they stumble and perish before you.
5 You upheld the justice of my cause;
you sat enthroned, an upright judge.

6 You have rebuked the nations, destroyed the wicked;
you have wiped out their name forever and ever.
7 The foe is destroyed, eternally ruined.
You uprooted their cities; their memory has perished.

8 But the Lord sits enthroned forever;
he has set up his throne for judgment.
9 He will judge the world with justice;
he will govern the peoples with equity.

10 For the oppressed, the Lord will be a stronghold,
a stronghold in times of distress.
11 Those who know your name will trust you;
you will not forsake those who seek you, O Lord.

12 Sing psalms to the Lord who dwells in Sion.
Tell his mighty works among the peoples,
13 for the Avenger of Blood has remembered them,
has not forgotten the cry of the poor.

14 Have mercy on me, O Lord;
see how I suffer from my foes,
you who raise me from the gates of death,
15 that I may recount all your praise
at the gates of daughter Sion,
and rejoice in your salvation.

16 The nations have fallen in the pit which they made;
their feet have been caught in the snare they laid.
17 The Lord has revealed himself; he has given judgment.
The wicked are snared by the work of their hands.

18 Let the wicked go down to the grave,
all the nations forgetful of God:
19 for the needy shall not always be forgotten,
nor the hopes of the poor ever perish.

20  Arise, O Lord, let human strength not prevail!
Let the nations be judged before you.
21 Strike them with terror, O Lord;
let the nations know they are but men.

Now and forever. Amen.
