Psalm 115

1 Not to ús, O LÓRD, not to ús,
but to your náme give the glóry,
for your mérciful lóve and fidélity.
2 Whý should the nátions sáy:
 ``Whére is their Gód?"

3 But our Gód is ín the héavens;
he dóes whatéver he wílls.
4 Their ídols are sílver and góld,
the wórk of húman hánds.

5 They have móuths but they cánnot spéak;
they have éyes but they cánnot sée.
6 They have éars but they cánnot héar;
they have nóstrils but they cánnot sméll.

7 They have hánds but they cánnot féel;
they have féet but they cánnot wálk.
They máke no sóund from their thróats.
8 Their mákers will come to be like them,
as will áll who trúst in them.

9 House of Ísrael, trúst in the LÓRD;
hé is their hélp and their shíeld.
10 House of Áaron, trúst in the LÓRD;
hé is their hélp and their shíeld.
11 Those who féar the LORD, trúst in the LÓRD;
hé is their hélp and their shíeld.

12 The LORD remémbers us, and hé will bléss us;
he will bléss the hóuse of Ísrael.
He will bléss the hóuse of Áaron.

13 He will bléss those who féar the LÓRD,
the líttle no léss than the gréat.
14 To yóu may the LÓRD grant íncrease,
to yóu and áll your chíldren.

15 Máy you be blést by the LÓRD,
the máker of héaven and éarth.
16 The héavens, the héavens belóng to the LÓRD,
but to the chíldren of mén, he has gíven the éarth.

17 The déad shall not práise the LÓRD,
nor thóse who go dówn into the sílence.
18 But wé who líve bless the LÓRD
both nów and forévermóre.

Alleluia!
