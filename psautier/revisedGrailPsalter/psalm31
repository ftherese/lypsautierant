Psalm 31

2 In you, O Lord, I take refuge.
Let me never be put to shame.
In your justice, set me free;
3 incline your ear to me, and speedily rescue me.

Be a rock of refuge for me,
a mighty stronghold to save me.
4 For you are my rock, my stronghold!
Lead me, guide me, for the sake of your name.

5 Release me from the snare they have hidden,
for you indeed are my refuge.
6 Into your hands I commend my spirit.
You will redeem me, O Lord, O faithful God.
7 You detest those who serve empty idols.
As for me, I trust in the Lord.

8 Let me be glad and rejoice in your mercy,
for you who have seen my affliction
and taken heed of my soul’s distress,
9 have not left me in the hands of the enemy,
but set my feet at large.

10 Have mercy on me, O Lord,
for I am in distress.
My eyes are wasted with grief,
my soul and my body.

11 For my life is spent with sorrow,
and my years with sighs.
Affliction has broken down my strength,
and my bones waste away.

12 Because of all my foes
I have become a reproach,
an object of scorn to my neighbors
and of fear to my friends.

Those who see me in the street
flee from me.
13 I am forgotten, like someone dead,
and have become like a broken vessel.

14 I have heard the slander of the crowd;
terror all around me,
as they plot together against me,
as they plan to take my life.

15 But as for me, I trust in you, O Lord;
I say, “You are my God.
16 My lot is in your hands, deliver me
from the hands of my enemies
and those who pursue me.

17 Let your face shine on your servant.
Save me in your merciful love.
18 Let me not be put to shame, O Lord,
for I call on you;
let the wicked be shamed!
Let them be silenced in the grave!

19 Let lying lips be stilled,
that speak haughtily against the just man
with pride and contempt.”

20  How great is the goodness, Lord,
that you keep for those who fear you,
that you show to those who trust you
in the sight of the children of men.

21 You hide them in the shelter of your presence,
secure from human scheming;
you keep them safe within your tent
from disputing tongues.

22 Blest be the Lord for he has wondrously shown me
his merciful love in a fortified city!

23 “I am far removed from your sight,”
I said in my alarm.
Yet you heard the voice of my plea
when I cried to you for help.

24 Love the Lord, all you his saints.
The Lord guards the faithful.
But the Lord will repay to the full
the one who acts with pride.
25 Be strong, let your heart take courage,
all who hope in the Lord.

Now and forever. Amen.
