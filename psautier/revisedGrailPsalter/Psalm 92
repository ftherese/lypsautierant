Psalm 92

2 It is góod to give thánks to the Lórd,
to make músic to your náme, O Most Hígh,
3 to procláim your loving mércy in the mórning,
and your trúth in the wátches of the níght,
4 on the tén-stringed lýre and the lúte,
with the sóund of sóng on the hárp.

5 You have gláddened me, O Lórd, by your déeds;
for the wórk of your hánds I shout with jóy.
6 O Lórd, how gréat are your wórks!
How déep are yóur desígns!
7 The sénseless cánnot knów this,
and the fóol cannót understánd.

8 Though the wícked spring úp like gráss,
and áll who do évil thríve,
they are dóomed to be etérnally destróyed.
9 But you, O Lórd, are etérnally on hígh.

10 Sée, your énemies, O Lórd,
sée, your énemies will pérish;
áll who do évil will be scáttered.

11 To mé you give the wíld ox’s stréngth;
you have poured óut on me púrest óil.
12 My éyes looked in tríumph on my fóes;
my éars heard gládly of their fáll.

13 The júst will flóurish like the pálm tree,
and grów like a Lébanon cédar.

14 Plánted in the hóuse of the Lórd,
they will flóurish in the cóurts of our Gód,
15 stíll bearing frúit when they are óld,
stíll full of sáp, still gréen,
16 to procláim that the Lórd is úpright.
In hím, my róck, there is no wróng.
