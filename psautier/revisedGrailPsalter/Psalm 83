Psalm 83

2 O Gód, do nót be sílent;
do not be stíll and unmóved, O Gód.
3 For your énemies ráise a túmult;
those who háte you líft up their héads.

4 They plót agáinst your péople,
conspíre against thóse you chérish.
5 They say, ``Cóme, let us destróy them as a nátion;
let not the náme of Ísrael be remémbered."

6 They conspíre with a síngle mínd;
against yóu they máke a cóvenant:
7 the cámps of Édom and of Íshmael,
of Móab and Hágar,

8 Gébal and Ámmon and Ámalek,
Philístia, with the péople of Týre.
9 Assýria, tóo, is their álly,
and joins hánds with the chíldren of Lót.

10 Tréat them like Mídian, like Sísera,
like Jábin at the Ríver Kíshon,
11 thóse who were destróyed at Éndor,
whose bódies rótted on the gróund.

12 Make their cáptains like Óreb and Zéeb,
all their prínces like Zébah and Zalmúnna,
13 the mén who sáid, ``Let us táke
the fíelds of Gód for oursélves."

14 My God, scátter them líke the whírlwind,
dríve them like cháff in the wínd!
15 As fíre that búrns away the fórest,
as the fláme that sets the móuntains abláze,
16 dríve them awáy with your témpest,
and fíll them with térror at your stórm.

17 Cóver their fáces with sháme,
so that they séek your náme, O Lórd.
18 Shame and térror be théirs foréver.
Lét them be disgráced; let them pérish!

19 Let them knów that yóu alóne,
yóu whose náme is the Lórd,
are the Most Hígh over áll the éarth.
