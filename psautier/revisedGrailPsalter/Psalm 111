Psalm 111

1 Alleluia!

I will práise the Lórd with all my héart,
in the méeting of the júst and the assémbly.
2 Gréat are the wórks of the Lórd,
to be póndered by áll who delíght in them.

3 Majéstic and glórious his wórk;
his jústice stands fírm foréver.
4 He has gíven us a memórial of his wónders.
The Lórd is grácious and mérciful.

5 He gives fóod to thóse who féar him;
keeps his cóvenant éver in mínd.
6 His mighty wórks he has shówn to his péople
by gíving them the héritage of nátions.

7 His hándiwork is jústice and trúth;
his précepts are áll of them súre,
8 standing fírm foréver and éver,
wróught in úprightness and trúth.

9 He has sént redémption to his péople,
and estáblished his cóvenant foréver.
Hóly his náme, to be féared.

10 The fear of the Lórd is the begínning of wísdom;
understánding marks áll who attáin it.
His práise endúres foréver!
