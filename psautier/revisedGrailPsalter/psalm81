Psalm 81

2 Sing joyfully to God our strength,
shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.
3 Raise a song and sound the timbrel,
the sweet-sounding harp and the lute;
4 blow the trumpet at the new moon,
when the moon is full, on our feast.

5 For this is a statute in Israel,
a command of the God of Jacob.
6 He made it a decree for Joseph,
when he went out from the land of Egypt.

A voice I did not know said to me:
7 “I freed your shoulder from the burden;
your hands were freed from the builder’s basket.
8 You called in distress and I delivered you.

I answered, concealed in the thunder;
at the waters of Meribah I tested you.
9 Listen, my people, as I warn you.
O Israel, if only you would heed!

10 Let there be no strange god among you,
nor shall you worship a foreign god.
11 I am the Lord your God,
who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it.

12 But my people did not heed my voice,
and Israel would not obey me.
13 So I left them in their stubbornness of heart,
to follow their own designs.

14 O that my people would heed me,
that Israel would walk in my ways!
15 At once I would subdue their foes,
turn my hand against their enemies.

16 Those who hate the Lord would cringe before him,
and their subjection would last forever.
17 But Israel I would feed with finest wheat,
and satisfy with honey from the rock.”

Now and forever. Amen.
