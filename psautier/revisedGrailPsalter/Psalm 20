Psalm 20

2 May the Lord ánswer you in tíme of tríal;
may the náme of Jacob’s Gód protéct you.
3 May he sénd you hélp from the hóly place,
and gíve you suppórt from Síon.

4 May he remémber áll your ófferings,
and recéive your sácrifice with fávor.
5 May he gíve you your héart’s desíre,
and fulfíll every óne of your pláns.

6 May we ríng out our jóy at your víctory,
and raise bánners in the náme of our Gód.
May the Lórd grant áll your práyers.

7 Now I knów the Lord sáves his anóinted,
and ánswers from his hóly héaven
with the míghty víctory of his hánd.

8 Sóme put their trúst in cháriots or hórses,
but wé in the náme of the Lórd, our Gód.
9 Théy will collápse and fáll,
but wé shall rise úp and hold fírm.
10 Grant salvátion to the kíng, O Lórd,
give ánswer on the dáy we cáll.
