Psalm 20

2 May the Lord answer you in time of trial;
may the name of Jacob’s God protect you.
3 May he send you help from the holy place,
and give you support from Sion.

4 May he remember all your offerings,
and receive your sacrifice with favor.
5 May he give you your heart’s desire,
and fulfill every one of your plans.

6 May we ring out our joy at your victory,
and raise banners in the name of our God.
May the Lord grant all your prayers.

7 Now I know the Lord saves his anointed,
and answers from his holy heaven
with the mighty victory of his hand.

8 Some put their trust in chariots or horses,
but we in the name of the Lord, our God.
9 They will collapse and fall,
but we shall rise up and hold firm.
10 Grant salvation to the king, O Lord,
give answer on the day we call.
