Psalm 85

2 O Lórd, you have fávored your lánd,
and brought báck the cáptives of Jácob.
3 You forgáve the guílt of your péople,
and cóvered áll their síns.
4 You avérted áll your ráge;
you turned báck the héat of your ánger.

5 Bring us báck, O Gód, our sávior!
Put an énd to your gríevance agáinst us.
6 Will you be ángry with ús foréver?
Will your ánger last from áge to áge?

7 Will you nót restóre again our lífe,
that your péople may rejóice in yóu?
8 Let us sée, O Lórd, your mércy,
and gránt us yóur salvátion.

9 I will héar what the Lórd God spéaks;
he speaks of péace for his péople and his fáithful,
and those who túrn their héarts to hím.
10 His salvátion is néar for those who féar him,
and his glóry will dwéll in our lánd.

11 Merciful lóve and fáithfulness have mét;
jústice and péace have kíssed.
12 Fáithfulness shall spríng from the éarth,
and jústice look dówn from héaven.

13 Also the Lórd will bestów his bóunty,
and our éarth shall yíeld its íncrease.
14 Jústice will márch befóre him,
and gúide his stéps on the wáy.
