Psalm 123

1 To yóu have I lífted up my éyes,
you who dwéll in the héavens.

2 Behóld, like the éyes of sláves
on the hánd of their LÓRDs,
líke the éyes of a sérvant
on the hánd of her místress,
so our éyes are on the LÓRD our Gód,
till he shów us his mércy.

3 Have mércy on us, LÓRD, have mércy.
We are fílled with contémpt.
4 Indéed, all too fúll is our sóul
with the scórn of the árrogant,
the disdáin of the próud.
