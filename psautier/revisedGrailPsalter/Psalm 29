Psalm 29

1 Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly powers,
ascribe to the Lord glory and strength.
2 Ascribe to the Lord the glory of his name;
bow down before the Lord, majestic in holiness.

3 The voice of the Lord upon the waters,
the God of glory thunders;
the Lord on the immensity of waters;
4 the voice of the Lord full of power;
the voice of the Lord full of splendor.

5 The voice of the Lord shatters cedars,
the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon;
6 he makes Lebanon leap like a calf,
and Sirion like a young wild-ox.

7 The voice of the Lord flashes flames of fire.
8 The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness,
the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh;
9 the voice of the Lord rends the oak tree
and strips the forest bare.
In his temple they all cry, “Glory!”

10 The Lord sat enthroned above the flood;
the Lord sits as king forever.
11 The Lord will give strength to his people,
the Lord will bless his people with peace.
