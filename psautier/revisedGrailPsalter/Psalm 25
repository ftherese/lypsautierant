Psalm 25

1 To you, O Lórd, I líft up my sóul.
2 In yóu, O my Gód, I have trústed;
let me nót be pút to sháme;
let not my énemies exúlt over mé.
3 Let none who hópe in yóu be put to sháme;
but shámed are those who wántonly break fáith.

4 O Lórd, make me knów your wáys.
Téach me your páths.
5 Guíde me in your trúth, and téach me;
for yóu are the Gód of my salvátion.
I have hóped in yóu all day lóng.

6 Remémber your compássion, O Lórd,
and your mérciful lóve,
for théy are from of óld.

7 Do not remémber the síns of my yóuth,
nor mý transgréssions.
In your mérciful lóve remémber me,
becáuse of your góodness, O Lórd.

8 Góod and úpright is the Lórd;
he shóws the wáy to sínners.
9 He guídes the húmble in right judgment;
to the húmble he téaches his wáy.

10 All the Lord’s páths are mércy and fáithfulness,
for those who kéep his cóvenant and commánds.
11 O Lórd, for the sáke of your náme,
forgíve my guílt, for it is gréat.

12 Who is thís that féars the Lórd?
He will shów him the páth to chóose.
13 His sóul shall líve in háppiness,
and his descéndants shall posséss the lánd.
14 The Lord’s sécret is for thóse who féar him;
to thém he revéals his cóvenant.

15 My éyes are álways on the Lórd,
for he réscues my féet from the snáre.
16 Turn to mé and have mércy on mé,
for Í am alóne and póor.

17 Relíeve the ánguish of my héart,
and sét me frée from my distréss.
18 Sée my lówliness and súffering,
and táke away áll my síns.

19 Sée how mány are my fóes;
with a víolent hátred they háte me.
20  Presérve my lífe and réscue me.
Let me nót be pút to sháme,
for in yóu I trúst.

21 May intégrity and vírtue protéct me,
for I have hóped in yóu, O Lórd.
22 Redéem Ísrael, O Gód,
from áll its distréss.
