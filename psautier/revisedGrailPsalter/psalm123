Psalm 119:25-32

25 My soul holds fast to the dust;
revive me by your word.
26 I declared my ways and you answered me;
teach me your statutes.

27 Make me grasp the way of your precepts,
and I will ponder your wonders.
28 My soul pines away with grief;
by your word raise me up.

29 Keep me from the way of falsehood;
grant me mercy by your law.
30  I have chosen the way of faithfulness;
your decrees I have upheld.

31 I cling to your decrees, O Lord;
let me not be put to shame.
32 I will run the way of your commands;
you open wide my heart.

Now and forever. Amen.
