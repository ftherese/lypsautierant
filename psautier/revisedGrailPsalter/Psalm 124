Psalm 124

1 ``If the LÓRD had not béen on our síde,"
let Ísrael sáy—
2 ``If the LÓRD had not béen on our síde
when péople rose agáinst us,
3 thén would they have swállowed us alíve
when their ánger was kíndled.

4 Thén would the wáters have engúlfed us,
the tórrent gone óver us;
5 óver our héad would have swépt
the ráging wáters."

6 Blést be the LÓRD who did not gíve us
a préy to their téeth!
7 Our lífe, like a bírd, has escáped
from the snáre of the fówler.

Indéed, the snáre has been bróken,
and wé have escáped.
8 Our hélp is in the náme of the LÓRD,
who made héaven and éarth.
