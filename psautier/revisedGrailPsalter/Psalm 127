Psalm 127

1 If the LÓRD does not buíld the hóuse,
in váin do its buílders lábor;
if the LÓRD does not guárd the cíty,
in váin does the guárd keep wátch.

2 In váin is your éarlier rísing,
your góing láter to rést,
you who tóil for the bréad you éat,
when he pours gífts on his belóved while they slúmber.

3 Yes, chíldren are a gíft from the LÓRD,
a bléssing, the frúit of the wómb.
4 Indéed, the sóns of yóuth
are like árrows in the hánd of a wárrior.

5 Bléssed ís the wárrior
who has fílled his quíver with these árrows!
He will háve no cáuse for sháme,
when he dispútes with his fóes in the gáteways.
