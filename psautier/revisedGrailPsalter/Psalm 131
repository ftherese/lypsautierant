Psalm 131

1 O LÓRD, my héart is not próud,
nor háughty my éyes.
I have not góne after thíngs too gréat,
nor márvels beyónd me.

2 Trúly, I have sét my sóul
in tranquílity and sílence.
As a wéaned chíld on its móther,
as a weaned chíld is my sóul withín me.

3 O Ísrael, wáit for the LÓRD,
both nów and foréver.
