Psalm 4

2 I cálled, the Gód of jústice gave me ánswer;
from ánguish you reléased me, have mércy and héar me!

3 Children of mán, how lóng will my glóry be dishónored,
will you lóve what is fútile and séek what is fálse?

4 Knów that the Lórd works wónders for his fáithful one;
the Lórd will héar me whenéver I cáll him.

5 Tremble, do not sín: pónder on your béd and be stíll.
6 Óffer right sácrifice, and trúst in the Lórd.

7 ``What can bríng us háppiness?" mány sáy.
Lift up the líght of your fáce on ús, O Lórd.

8 You have pút into my héart a gréater jóy
than abúndance of gráin and new wíne can províde.

9 In péace I will lie dówn and fáll asléep,
for yóu alone, O Lórd, make me dwéll in sáfety.
