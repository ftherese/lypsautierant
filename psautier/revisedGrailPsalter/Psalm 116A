Psalm 116A

1 I lóve the LÓRD, for he has héard
my vóice, my appéal;
2 for he has túrned his éar to mé
whenéver I cáll.

3 They surróunded me, the snáres of déath;
the ánguish of the gráve has fóund me;
ánguish and sórrow I fóund.
4 I cálled on the náme of the LÓRD:
``Delíver my sóul, O LÓRD!"

5 How grácious is the LÓRD, and júst;
our Gód has compássion.
6 The LÓRD protécts the símple;
I was brought lów, and he sáved me.

7 Turn báck, my sóul, to your rést,
for the LÓRD has been góod to yóu;
8 he has képt my sóul from déath,
my eyes from téars, and my féet from stúmbling.
9 I will wálk in the présence of the LÓRD
in the lánd of the líving.
