Psalm 138

1 I thank you, LORD, with all my heart;
you have heard the words of my mouth.
In the presence of the angels I praise you.
2 I bow down toward your holy temple.

I give thanks to your name
for your merciful love and your faithfulness.
You have exalted your name over all.
3 On the day I called, you answered me;
you increased the strength of my soul.

4 All earthâ€™s kings shall thank you, O LORD,
when they hear the words of your mouth.
5 They shall sing of the ways of the LORD,
``How great is the glory of the LORD!"

6 The LORD is high, yet he looks on the lowly,
and the haughty he knows from afar.
7 You give me life though I walk amid affliction;
you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes.

With your right hand you save me;
8 the LORD will accomplish this for me.
O LORD, your merciful love is eternal;
discard not the work of your hands.
