Psalm 55

2 Give éar, O Gód, to my práyer;
do not híde from my pléading.
3 Atténd to mé and replý;
with my cáres, I cannot rést.

4 I trémble at the shóuts of the fóe,
at the críes of the wícked,
for they píle up évil upón me;
in ánger they malígn me.

5 My héart is strícken withín me;
death’s térror falls upón me.
6 Trémbling and féar come óver me,
and hórror overwhélms me.

7 I say, ``Ó that I had wíngs like a dóve,
to fly awáy and be at rést!
8 I would indéed escápe far awáy,
and take réfuge in the désert.
9 Í shall awáit him who sáves me
from the ráging wind and témpest."

10 Engúlf and confúse their speech, O Lórd,
for I see víolence and strífe in the cíty!
11 Night and dáy they patról its wálls.
In its mídst are wíckedness and évil.

12 Destrúction líes withín it.
Its stréets are néver frée
from týranny and decéit.

13 If an énemy made táunts agáinst me,
Í could béar it.
If my ríval had rísen agáinst me,
I could híde from hím.

14 But it is yóu, as my équal, my fríend,
whom I knéw so wéll,
15 with whóm I enjóyed friendly cóunsel!
We wálked togéther in hármony
in the hóuse of Gód.

16 May déath fall súddenly upón them!
Let them go dówn alive to the gráve,
for wíckedness dwélls in their hómes,
and déep in their héarts.

17 As for mé, I will crý to Gód,
and the Lórd will sáve me.
18 Évening, mórning, and at nóon,
I will crý and lamént,
and he will héar my vóice.

19 He will redéem my sóul in péace
in the attáck agáinst me,
for thóse who fíght me are mány.

20  Gód, who is enthróned foréver,
will héar them and húmble them.
For théy will not aménd their wáys;
they have no féar of Gód.

21 The tráitor has túrned against his fríends;
he has bróken his páct.
22 His spéech is sófter than bútter,
but wár is in his héart.
His wórds are smóother than óil,
but they are swórds unshéathed.

23 Entrúst your cáres to the Lórd,
and hé will suppórt you.
Hé will néver allów
the júst man to stúmble.

24 But you will bríng them dówn, O Gód,
to the pít of déath:
the blóodthirsty ánd the líars
shall not líve even hálf their dáys.
But Í, I will trúst in you, O Lórd.
