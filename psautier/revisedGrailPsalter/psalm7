Psalm 7

2 O Lord, my God, I take refuge in you.
Save and rescue me from all my pursuers,
3 lest they tear me apart like a lion,
and drag me off with no one to rescue me.

4 If I have done this, O Lord, my God,
5 if I have paid back evil for good,
I who saved my unjust oppressor:
6 then let my foe pursue my soul and seize me;
let him trample my life to the ground,
and lay my honor in the dust.

7 O Lord, rise up in your anger;
be exalted against the fury of my foes.
Awake, my God, to enact 
the justice you ordered.
8 Let the company of peoples gather round you,
as you take your seat above them on high.

9 The Lord is judge of the peoples.
Give judgment for me, O Lord,
for I am just and blameless of heart.


10 Put an end to the evil of the wicked!
Make the just man stand firm;
it is you who test mind and heart,
O God of justice!

11 God is a shield before me,
who saves the upright of heart.
12 God is a judge, just and powerful and patient,
not exercising anger every day.

13 Against someone who does not repent,
God will sharpen his sword;
he bends his bow and makes ready.
14 For such a one he prepares deadly weapons;
he barbs his arrows with fire.

15 Here is one who conceives iniquity;
pregnant with malice, he gives birth to lies.
16 He digs a pit and bores it deep;
and in the trap he has made he falls.
17 His malice recoils on his head;
on his own skull his violence falls.

18 I thank the Lord for his justice,
singing to the name of the Lord, the Most High.

Now and forever. Amen.
