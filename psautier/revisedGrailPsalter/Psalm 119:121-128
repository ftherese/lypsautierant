Psalm 119:121-128

121 I have done what is just and right;
do not leave me to my foes.
122 Guarantee the well-being of your servant;
let not the proud oppress me.

123 My eyes grow weary as I watch for your salvation,
and for your promise of justice.
124 Treat your servant with merciful love,
and teach me your statutes.

125 I am your servant; give me understanding:
then I shall know your decrees.
126 It is time for the LORD to act,
for your law has been broken.

127 That is why I love your commands
more than finest gold,
128 why I rule my life by your precepts,
and hate false ways.
