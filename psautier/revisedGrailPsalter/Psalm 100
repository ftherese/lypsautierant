Psalm 100

1 Cry out with jóy to the Lórd, all the éarth.
2 Sérve the Lórd with gládness.
Come befóre him, sínging for jóy.

3 Know that hé, the Lórd, is Gód.
He máde us; we belóng to hím.
We are his péople, the shéep of his flóck.

4 Énter his gátes with thanksgíving
and his cóurts with sóngs of práise.
Give thánks to him, and bléss his náme.

5 Indéed, how góod is the Lórd,
etérnal his mérciful lóve.
He is fáithful from áge to áge.
