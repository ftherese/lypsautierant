Psalm 119:41-48

41 LORD, let your mercy come upon me,
the salvation you have promised.
42 I shall answer those who taunt me,
for I trust in your word.

43 Never take the word of truth from my mouth,
for I hope in your decrees.
44 I shall always keep your law,
forever and ever.

45 I shall walk on a spacious plain,
for I seek your precepts.
46 I will speak of your decrees before kings,
and not be abashed.

47 In your commands I have found my delight;
these I have loved.
48 I reach out to your commands, which I love,
and ponder your statutes.
