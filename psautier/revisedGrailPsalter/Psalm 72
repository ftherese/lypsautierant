Psalm 72

1 O Gód, give your júdgment to the kíng,
to a king’s són your jústice,
2 that he may júdge your péople in jústice,
and your póor in right júdgment.

3 May the móuntains bring forth péace for the péople,
and the hílls jústice.
4 May he defénd the póor of the péople,
and sáve the chíldren of the néedy,
and crúsh the oppréssor.

5 He shall endúre like the sún and the móon
through áll generátions.
6 He shall descénd like ráin on the méadow,
like shówers that wáter the éarth.
7 In his dáys shall jústice flóurish,
and great péace till the móon is no móre.

8 He shall rúle from séa to séa,
from the Ríver to the bóunds of the éarth.
9 Let the désert dwellers fáll befóre him,
and his énemies líck the dúst.

10 The kíngs of Társhish and the íslands
shall páy him tríbute.
The kíngs of Shéba and Séba
shall bríng him gífts.
11 Before hím all kíngs shall fall próstrate,
all nátions shall sérve him.

12 For he shall sáve the néedy when they crý,
the póor, and thóse who are hélpless.
13 He will have píty on the wéak and the néedy,
and save the líves of the néedy.
14 From oppréssion and víolence he redéems their sóuls;
to him their blóod is déar.

15 Lóng máy he líve!
May the góld of Shéba be gíven him.
They shall práy for hím without céasing,
and bléss him áll the dáy.

16 May gráin be abúndant in the lánd,
wáving to the péaks of the móuntains.
May its frúit rústle like Lébanon;
may the péople flóurish in the cíties
like gráss on the éarth.

17 May his náme endúre foréver,
his náme contínue like the sún.
Every tríbe shall be blést in hím,
all nátions shall cáll him bléssed.

[18]Blést be the Lórd, God of Ísrael,
who alóne works wónders,
[19]ever blést his glórious náme.
Let his glóry fill the éarth.
Amén! Amén!
