Psalm 74

1 Whý, O Gód, have you cást us off foréver?
Why does your ánger bláze at the shéep of your pásture?
2 Remémber your flóck which you cláimed long agó,
the tríbe you redéemed to be your ówn posséssion,
this móuntain of Síon whére you máde your dwélling.

3 Turn your stéps to these pláces that are útterly rúined!
The énemy has laid wáste the whóle of the hóly place.
4 Your fóes have made úproar in the mídst of your assémbly;
they have sét up their émblems as tókens thére.
5 They have wíelded their áxes on hígh,
as at the éntrance to a gróve of trées.

6 Théy have bróken down áll the cárvings;
they have strúck togéther with hátchet and píckax.
7 O Gód, they have sét your hóly place on fíre;
they have rázed and profáned the abóde of your náme.

8 They sáid in their héarts, ``We will útterly crúsh them;
we will búrn every shríne of Gód in the lánd."
9 We do not sée our émblems, nór is there a próphet;
we have nó one to téll us how lóng it will lást.

10 How lóng, O Gód, is the énemy to scóff?
Is the fóe to insúlt your náme foréver?
11 Whý, O Lórd, do you hóld back your hánd?
Why do you kéep your ríght hand hídden in your clóak?

12 Yet Gód is my kíng from time pást,
who bestóws salvátion through áll the lánd.
13 It was yóu who divíded the séa by your míght,
who sháttered the héads of the mónsters in the séa.

14 It was yóu who crúshed Levíathan’s héads,
and gáve him as fóod to the béasts of the désert.
15 It was yóu who ópened up spríngs and tórrents;
it was yóu who dríed up éver-flowing rívers.

16 Yóurs is the dáy and yóurs is the níght;
it was yóu who estáblished the líght and the sún.
17 It was yóu who fixed the bóunds of the éarth,
yóu who máde both súmmer and wínter.

18 Remémber this, O Lórd: the énemy scóffed!
A sénseless péople insúlted your náme!
19 Do not gíve the sóul of your dóve to the béasts,
nor forgét the lífe of your póor ones foréver.

20  Lóok to the cóvenant; each cáve in the lánd
is a pláce where víolence mákes its hóme.
21 Do not lét the oppréssed be pút to sháme;
let the póor and the néedy bléss your náme.

22 Aríse, O Gód, and defénd your cáuse!
Remémber how the sénseless revíle you all the dáy.
23 Dó not forgét the clámor of your fóes,
the uncéasing úproar of thóse who defý you.
