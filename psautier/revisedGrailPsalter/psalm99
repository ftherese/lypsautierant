Psalm 99

1 The Lord is king; the peoples tremble.
He is enthroned on the cherubim; earth quakes.
2 The Lord is great in Sion.
He is exalted over all the peoples.

3 Let them praise your great and awesome name.
Holy is he!
4 O mighty King, lover of justice,
you have established what is upright;
you have made justice and right in Jacob.

5 Exalt the Lord our God;
bow down before his footstool.
Holy is he!

6 Among his priests were Aaron and Moses;
among those who invoked his name was Samuel.
They cried out to the Lord and he answered.

7 To them he spoke in the pillar of cloud.
They obeyed his decrees and the statutes
which he had given them.

8 O Lord our God, you answered them.
For them you were a God who forgives,
and yet you punished their offenses.

9 Exalt the Lord our God;
bow down before his holy mountain,
for the Lord our God is holy.

Now and forever. Amen.
