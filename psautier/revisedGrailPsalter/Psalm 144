Psalm 144

1 Blést be the LÓRD, my róck,
who tráins my hánds for báttle,
who prepáres my fíngers for wár.

2 He is my mérciful lóve, my fórtress; 
hé is my strónghold, my sávior,
my shíeld in whóm I take réfuge.
He brings péoples únder my rúle.

3 LÓRD, what is mán that you regárd him,
the son of mán that you kéep him in mínd,
4 mán who is mérely a bréath,
whose dáys are like a pássing shádow? 

5 Lower your héavens, O LÓRD, and come dówn.
Touch the móuntains; wréathe them in smóke.
6 Flash your líghtnings; róut the fóe.
Shoot your árrows, and pút them to flíght.

7 Reach dówn with your hánd from on hígh;
rescue me, sáve me from the míghty wáters,
from the hánds of fóreign fóes
8 whose móuths speak ónly émptiness,
whose hánds are ráised in pérjury.

9 To you, O Gód, will I síng a new sóng;
I will play on the ten-stringed hárp
10 to yóu who give kíngs their víctory,
who set Dávid your sérvant frée
from the évil swórd.

11 Rescue me, frée me from the hánds of foreign fóes,
whose móuths speak ónly émptiness,
whose right hánds are ráised in pérjury.

12 Let our sóns then flóurish like sáplings,
grown táll and stróng from their yóuth;
our dáughters gráceful as cólumns,
as thóugh they were cárved for a pálace.

13 Let our bárns be fílled to overflówing
with cróps of évery kínd;
our shéep incréasing by thóusands,
téns of thóusands in our fíelds,
14 our cáttle héavy with yóung.

No rúined wáll, no éxile,
no sóund of wéeping in our stréets.
15 Blessed the péople of whóm this is trúe;
blessed the péople whose Gód is the LÓRD!
