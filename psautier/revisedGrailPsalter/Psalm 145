Psalm 145

1 I will extól you, my Gód and kíng,
and bless your náme foréver and éver.

2 I will bléss you dáy after dáy,
and praise your náme foréver and éver.
3 The LORD is gréat and híghly to be práised;
his gréatness cánnot be méasured.

4 Age to áge shall procláim your wórks,
shall decláre your míghty déeds.
5 They will téll of your great glóry and spléndor,
and recóunt your wónderful wórks.

6 They will spéak of your áwesome déeds,
recóunt your gréatness and míght.
7 They will recáll your abúndant góodness,
and síng of your just déeds with jóy.

8 The LORD is kínd and fúll of compássion,
slow to ánger, abóunding in mércy.
9 How góod is the LÓRD to áll,
compássionate to áll his créatures.

10 All your wórks shall thánk you, O LÓRD,
and áll your fáithful ones bléss you.
11 They shall spéak of the glóry of your réign,
and decláre your míghty déeds,

12 To make knówn your míght to the chíldren of mén,
and the glórious spléndor of your réign.
13 Your kíngdom is an éverlasting kíngdom;
your rule endúres for áll generátions.

The LORD is fáithful in all his words,
and hóly in áll his déeds.
14 The LÓRD suppórts all who fáll,
and ráises up áll who are bowed dówn.

15 The éyes of áll look to yóu,
and you gíve them their fóod in due séason.
16 You ópen your hánd and sátisfy
the desíre of every líving thíng.

17 The LORD is júst in áll his wáys,
and hóly in áll his déeds.
18 The LORD is clóse to áll who cáll him,
who cáll on hím in trúth.

19 He fulfílls the desíres of those who féar him;
he héars their crý and he sáves them.
20 The LORD keeps wátch over áll who lóve him;
the wícked he will útterly destróy.

21 Let my móuth speak the práise of the LÓRD;
let all flésh bless his hóly náme
foréver, for áges unénding.
