Psalm 49

2 Héar this, áll you péoples,
give éar, all who dwéll in the wórld,
3 péople both hígh and lów,
rích and póor alíke!

4 My móuth will útter wísdom.
The refléctions of my héart offer ínsight.
5 I will inclíne my éar to a mýstery;
with the hárp I will sét forth my próblem.

6 Whý should I féar in evil dáys
the málice of the fóes who surróund me,
7 thóse who trúst in their wéalth,
and bóast of the vástness of their ríches?

8 Nó man can ránsom a bróther,
nor pay a príce to Gód for his lífe.
9 How hígh is the príce of his sóul!
The ránsom can néver be enoúgh!
10 Nó one can búy life unénding,
nor avóid cóming to the gráve.

11 Anyone sées that the wíse will díe;
the fóolish will pérish with the sénseless,
and léave their wéalth to óthers.

12 Their gráves are their hómes foréver,
their dwélling place from áge to áge,
though lánds were cálled by their námes.

13 In his ríches, mán does not endúre;
hé is like the béasts that are destróyed.

14 Thís is the wáy of the fóolish,
the óutcome of those pléased with their lót:
15 like shéep they are dríven to the gráve,
where déath shall becóme their shépherd,
and the úpright shall háve domínion.

Their outward shów wastes awáy with the mórning,
and the gráve becómes their hóme.
16 But God will ránsom my sóul from the grasp of héll;
for hé indéed will recéive me.

17 Then do not féar when a mán grows rích,
when the glóry of his hóuse incréases.
18 He takes nóthing wíth him when he díes;
his glóry does not fóllow him belów.

19 Though he fláttered himsélf while he líved,
``People will práise me for áll my succéss,"
20 yet he will gó to jóin his fórebears,
and will néver see the líght anymóre.

21 In his ríches, mán cannot discérn;
hé is like the béasts that are destróyed.
