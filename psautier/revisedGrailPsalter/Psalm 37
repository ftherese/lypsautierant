Psalm 37

1 Do not fret because of the wicked;
do not envy those who do evil,
2 for they wither quickly like grass
and fade like the green of the fields.

3 Trust in the Lord and do good;
then you will dwell in the land and safely pasture. 
4 Find your delight in the Lord,
who grants your heart’s desire.

5 Commit your way to the Lord;
trust in him, and he will act,
6 and make your uprightness shine like the light,
the justice of your cause like the noonday sun.

7 Be still before the Lord and wait in patience;
do not fret at the one who prospers,
the one who makes evil plots.

8 Calm your anger and forget your rage;
do not fret, it only leads to evil.
9 For those who do evil shall perish.
But those who hope in the Lord,
they shall inherit the land.

10 A little longer—and the wicked one is gone.
Look at his place: he is not there.
11 But the humble shall own the land
and delight in fullness of peace.

12 The wicked one plots against the just man
and gnashes his teeth against him;
13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
for he sees that his day is at hand.

14 The wicked draw the sword, bend their bows,
to slaughter the poor and needy,
to slay those whose ways are upright.
15 Their sword shall pierce their own hearts,
and their bows shall be broken to pieces.

16 Better the few possessions of the just,
than the abundant wealth of the wicked;
17 for the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
and the Lord will support the just.

18 The Lord takes note of the days of the blameless;
their heritage will last forever.
19 They shall not be put to shame in evil days;
in time of famine they shall have their fill.

20  But all the wicked shall perish;
the enemies of the Lord shall be consumed.
They are like the beauty of the meadows;
they shall vanish, they shall vanish like smoke.
21 The wicked borrows and does not repay,
but the upright is generous and gives.
22 Those blessed by him shall inherit the land,
but those cursed by him shall be cut off.

23 By the Lord are the steps made firm
of one in whose path He delights.
24 Though he stumble he shall never fall,
for the Lord will hold him by the hand.

25 I was young and now I am old,
but I have never seen the just man forsaken
nor his children begging for bread.
26 All the day he is generous and lends,
and his children become a blessing.

27 Then turn away from evil and do good,
and you may abide forever;
28 for indeed, the Lord loves justice,
and will never forsake his faithful.

The unjust shall be wiped out forever,
and the descendants of the wicked destroyed.
29 The just shall inherit the land;
there they shall abide forever.

30  The mouth of the just man utters wisdom,
and his tongue tells forth what is just.
31 The law of his God is in his heart;
his steps shall be saved from stumbling.

32 The wicked man keeps watch for the just,
and seeks an occasion to destroy him.
33 The Lord will not leave him in his power,
nor let him be condemned when he is judged.

34 Then wait for the Lord, keep to his way.
He will exalt you to inherit the land,
and you will see the wicked destroyed.

35 I have seen the wicked one triumphant,
towering like a cedar of Lebanon.
36 I passed by again; he was gone.
I searched; he was nowhere to be found.

37 Mark the blameless, observe the upright; 
for the peaceful man a future lies in store,
38 but sinners shall all be destroyed.
No future lies in store for the wicked.

39 But from the Lord comes the salvation of the just,
their stronghold in time of distress.
40  The Lord helps them and rescues them,
rescues and saves them from the wicked:
because they take refuge in him.
