Psalm 34

2 I will bléss the Lórd at all tímes;
práise of him is always in my mouth.
3 In the Lórd my sóul shall make its bóast;
the húmble shall héar and be glád.

4 Glórify the Lórd with mé;
togéther let us práise his náme.
5 I sóught the Lórd, and he ánswered me;
from all my térrors he sét me frée.

6 Lóok toward hím and be rádiant;
let your fáces nót be abáshed.
7 This lówly one cálled; the Lord héard,
and réscued him from áll his distréss.

8 The ángel of the Lórd is encámped
around thóse who féar him, to réscue them.
9 Taste and sée that the Lórd is góod.
Blessed the mán who seeks réfuge in hím.

10 Féar the Lórd, you his hóly ones.
They lack nóthing, thóse who féar him.
11 The rích suffer wánt and go húngry,
but thóse who seek the Lórd lack no bléssing.

12 Cóme, chíldren, and héar me,
that I may téach you the féar of the Lórd.
13 Who ís it that désires lífe
and lóngs to see prósperous dáys?

14 Guárd your tóngue from évil,
and your líps from spéaking decéit.
15 Turn asíde from évil and do góod.
Séek after péace, and pursúe it.

16 The Lórd turns his éyes to the júst,
and his éars are ópen to their crý.
17 The Lórd turns his fáce against the wícked
to destróy their remémbrance from the éarth.

18 When the júst cry óut, the Lord héars,
and réscues them in áll their distréss.
19 The Lord is clóse to the brókenhéarted;
those whose spírit is crúshed he will sáve.

20  Mány are the tríals of the júst man,
but from them áll the Lórd will réscue him.
21 He will keep guárd over áll his bónes;
not óne of his bónes shall be bróken.

22 Évil brings déath to the wícked;
those who háte the júst man are dóomed.
23 The Lord ránsoms the sóuls of his sérvants.
All who trúst in him shall nót be condémned.
