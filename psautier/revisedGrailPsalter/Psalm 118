Psalm 118

1 Give práise to the LÓRD, for he is góod;
his mércy endúres foréver.

2 Let the hóuse of Ísrael sáy,
``His mércy endúres foréver."
3 Let the hóuse of Áaron sáy,
``His mércy endúres foréver."
4 Let thóse who féar the LORD sáy,
``His mércy endúres foréver."

5 I cálled to the LÓRD in my distréss;
he has ánswered and fréed me.
6 The LÓRD is at my síde; I do not féar.
What can mankínd dó agáinst me?
7 The LÓRD is at my síde as my hélper;
I shall lóok in tríumph on my fóes.

8 It is bétter to take réfuge in the LÓRD
than to trúst in mán;
9 it is bétter to take réfuge in the LÓRD
than to trúst in prínces.

10 The nátions all encírcled mé;
in the náme of the LÓRD I cut them óff.
11 They encírcled me áll aróund;
in the náme of the LÓRD I cut them óff.

12 They encírcled me abóut like bées;
they blázed like a fíre among thórns.
In the náme of the LÓRD I cut them óff.

13 I was thrust dówn, thrust dówn and fálling,
but the LÓRD was my hélper.
14 The LÓRD is my stréngth and my sóng;
hé was my sávior.

15 There are shóuts of jóy and salvátion
in the ténts of the júst.
``The LORD’s right hánd has done mighty deeds;
16 his ríght hand is exálted.
The LORD’s right hánd has done míghty déeds."

17 I shall not díe, Í shall líve
and recóunt the déeds of the LÓRD.
18 The LORD púnished me, púnished me sevérely,
but did nót hand me óver to déath.

19 Open to mé the gátes of jústice:
I will énter and thánk the LÓRD.
20  Thís is the LÓRD’s own gáte,
where the júst énter.
21 I will thánk you, for yóu have ánswered,
and yóu are my sávior.

22 The stóne that the buílders rejécted
has becóme the córnerstone.
23 By the LÓRD has thís been dóne,
a márvel in our éyes.
24 This is the dáy the LÓRD has máde;
let us rejóice in ít and be glád.

25 O LÓRD, grant salvátion;
O LÓRD, gránt succéss.
26 Blést is hé who cómes
in the náme of the LÓRD.
We bléss you from the hóuse of the LÓRD;
27 the LORD is Gód, and has gíven us líght.

Go fórward in procéssion with bránches,
as fár as the hórns of the áltar.
28 Yóu are my Gód, I práise you.
My Gód, I exált you.
29 Give práise to the LÓRD, for he is góod;
his mércy endúres foréver.
