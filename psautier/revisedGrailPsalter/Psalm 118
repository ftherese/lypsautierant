Psalm 118

1 Give praise to the LORD, for he is good;
his mercy endures forever.

2 Let the house of Israel say,
``His mercy endures forever."
3 Let the house of Aaron say,
``His mercy endures forever."
4 Let those who fear the LORD say,
``His mercy endures forever."

5 I called to the LORD in my distress;
he has answered and freed me.
6 The LORD is at my side; I do not fear.
What can mankind do against me?
7 The LORD is at my side as my helper;
I shall look in triumph on my foes.

8 It is better to take refuge in the LORD
than to trust in man;
9 it is better to take refuge in the LORD
than to trust in princes.

10 The nations all encircled me;
in the name of the LORD I cut them off.
11 They encircled me all around;
in the name of the LORD I cut them off.

12 They encircled me about like bees;
they blazed like a fire among thorns.
In the name of the LORD I cut them off.

13 I was thrust down, thrust down and falling,
but the LORD was my helper.
14 The LORD is my strength and my song;
he was my savior.

15 There are shouts of joy and salvation
in the tents of the just.
``The LORD’s right hand has done mighty deeds;
16 his right hand is exalted.
The LORD’s right hand has done mighty deeds."

17 I shall not die, I shall live
and recount the deeds of the LORD.
18 The LORD punished me, punished me severely,
but did not hand me over to death.

19 Open to me the gates of justice:
I will enter and thank the LORD.
20  This is the LORD’s own gate,
where the just enter.
21 I will thank you, for you have answered,
and you are my savior.

22 The stone that the builders rejected
has become the cornerstone.
23 By the LORD has this been done,
a marvel in our eyes.
24 This is the day the LORD has made;
let us rejoice in it and be glad.

25 O LORD, grant salvation;
O LORD, grant success.
26 Blest is he who comes
in the name of the LORD.
We bless you from the house of the LORD;
27 the LORD is God, and has given us light.

Go forward in procession with branches,
as far as the horns of the altar.
28 You are my God, I praise you.
My God, I exalt you.
29 Give praise to the LORD, for he is good;
his mercy endures forever.
