Psalm 60

3 O Gód, you have rejécted us, and bróken us.
You have been ángry; come báck to ús.

4 You have máde the earth quáke, torn it ópen.
Repáir what is sháttered, for it swáys.
5 You have inflícted hárdships on your péople,
made us drínk a wíne that dázed us.

6 For those who féar you, you gáve the sígnal
to flée from the fáce of the bów.
7 With your right hánd, grant salvátion, and give ánswer,
that thóse whom you lóve may be frée.

8 From his hóly place Gód has spóken:
``I will exúlt, and divíde the land of Shéchem;
I will méasure out the válley of Súccoth.

9 Mine is Gílead, míne is Manásseh;
Éphraim I táke for my hélmet,
Júdah ís my scépter.

10 Móab is my wáshbowl;
on Édom I will cást my shóe.
Over Philístia I will shóut in tríumph."

11 But who will léad me to the fórtified cíty?
Whó will bríng me to Édom?
12 Have yóu, O Gód, rejécted us?
Will you márch with our ármies no lónger?

13 Gíve us hélp against the fóe,
for the hélp of mán is váin.
14 With Gód, wé shall do brávely,
and hé will trámple down our fóes.
