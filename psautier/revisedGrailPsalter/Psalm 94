Psalm 94

1 O Lórd, avénging Gód,
avénging Gód, shine fórth!
2 Júdge of the éarth, aríse;
gíve the próud what they desérve!

3 How lóng, O Lórd, shall the wícked,
how lóng shall the wícked tríumph?
4 They blúster with árrogant spéech;
those who do évil bóast to each óther.

5 They crúsh your péople, Lórd;
and they húmble yóur inhéritance.
6 They kíll the wídow and the stránger,
and múrder the fátherless chíld.

7 And they sáy, ``The Lórd does not sée;
the God of Jácob páys no héed."
8 Mark thís, you sénseless péople;
fóols, when wíll you understánd?

9 Can he who plánted the éar not héar?
Can he who fórmed the éye not sée?
10 Will he who tráins the nátions not púnish?
Will he who téaches mán not have knówledge?
11 The Lórd knows the pláns of mán.
He knóws they are no móre than a bréath.

12 Blessed the mán whom you díscipline, O Lórd,
whom you tráin by méans of your láw;
13 to whóm you give péace in evil dáys,
while the pít is being dúg for the wícked.

14 The Lórd will not abándon his péople,
nor forsáke thóse who are his héritage;
15 for júdgment shall agáin be júst,
and áll true héarts shall uphóld it.

16 Who will stand úp for me agáinst the wícked?
Who will defénd me from thóse who do évil?
17 If the Lórd were nót to hélp me,
my soul would sóon go dówn to the sílence.

18 When I thínk, ``I have lóst my fóothold,"
your mércy, O Lórd, holds me úp.
19 When cáres incréase in my héart,
your consolátion cálms my sóul.

20  Can júdges who do évil be your fríends?
They do injústice under cóver of láw;
21 they attáck the lífe of the júst,
and condémn the ínnocent to déath.

22 As for mé, the Lórd will be a strónghold;
my Gód will be the róck where I take réfuge.
23 Hé will repáy them for their wíckedness,
destróy them for their évil déeds.
The Lórd, our Gód, will destróy them.
