39 But yet you have spurned and rejected,
you are angry with the one you have anointed.
40  You have renounced your covenant with your servant,
and dishonored his crown in the dust.

41 You have broken down all his walls,
and reduced his fortresses to ruins.
42 All who pass by despoil him;
he has become the taunt of his neighbors.

43 You have exalted the right hand of his foes;
you have made all his enemies rejoice.
44 You have turned back the edge of his sword;
you have not upheld him in battle.

45 You have brought his glory to an end;
you have hurled his throne to the ground.
46 You have cut short the days of his youth;
you have heaped disgrace upon him.

47 How long, O Lord? Will you hide yourself forever?
How long will your anger burn like a fire?
48 Remember the shortness of my life,
and how frail you have made the children of men.
49 What man can live and never see death?
Who can save himself from the grasp of the tomb?

50  Where are your mercies of the past, O Lord,
which you swore in your faithfulness to David?
51 Remember, O Lord, the taunts to your servant,
how I have to bear all the insults of the peoples.
52 Thus your enemies lift up a taunt, O Lord,
taunting your anointed at every step.

53 Blest be the Lord forever.
Amen and amen!
