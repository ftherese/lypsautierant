Psalm 82

1 God stands in the divine assembly.
In the midst of the gods, he gives judgment.

2 “How long will you judge unjustly,
and favor the cause of the wicked?
3 Do justice for the weak and the orphan;
give justice to the poor and afflicted.
4 Rescue the weak and the needy;
set them free from the hand of the wicked.”

5 They neither know nor understand;
they walk about in darkness,
and all the earth’s foundations are shaken.

6 I have said to you, “You are gods,
and all of you, sons of the Most High.
7 And yet, like men you shall die;
you shall fall, like any of the princes.”

8 Arise, O God; judge the earth!
For all the nations are yours.
