Psalm 39

2 I sáid, ``I will be wátchful of my wáys,
for féar I should sín with my tóngue.
I will pút a cúrb on my líps
when the wícked man stánds befóre me."
3 I was múte, sílent, very stíll,
as my páin becáme inténse.

4 My héart was búrning withín me.
At the thóught of it, the fíre blazed úp,
and my tóngue búrst into spéech:
5 ``O Lórd, you have shówn me my énd,
how shórt is the léngth of my dáys.
Now I know how fleeting is my life.

6 How shórt the span of dáys you have gíven me;
my lífe is as nóthing in your síght.
Surely áll mankind stánds as but a bréath.
7 A man súrely líves as a shádow,
surely the ríches he hóards, a mere bréath;
he does not knów who will gáther thém."

8 And nów, Lord, whát is there to wáit for?
In yóu rests áll my hópe.
9 Set me frée from all my sins;
do not make me the taunt of the fool.
10 I was silent, not opening my lips,
because this was all your doing.

11 Take away your scourge from me.
I am crushed by the blows of your hand.
12 With rebukes you correct the sinner;
like a moth you devour all he treasures.
All mankind is no more than a breath.

13 O Lord, give heed to my prayer;
turn your ear to my cry;
do not be deaf to my weeping.
Behold, I am a stranger to you,
a pilgrim, like all my forebears.

14 Look away from me that I may smile
before I depart to be no more.
