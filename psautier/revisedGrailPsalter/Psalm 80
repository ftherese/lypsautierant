Psalm 80

2 O shépherd of Ísrael, héar us,
yóu who lead Jóseph like a flóck:
enthróned on the chérubim, shine fórth
3 upon Éphraim, Bénjamin, Manásseh.
Rouse up your míght and cóme to sáve us.

4 O Gód, bríng us báck;
let your face shíne on us, and wé shall be sáved.

5 How lóng, O Lórd, God of hósts,
will you be ángry at the práyer of your péople?
6 You have féd them with téars for their bréad,
an abúndance of téars for their drínk.
7 You have máde us the táunt of our néighbors;
our foes móck us amóng themsélves.

8 O Gód of hósts, bríng us báck;
let your fáce shine fórth, and wé shall be sáved.

9 You bróught a víne out of Égypt;
you dróve out the nátions and plánted it.
10 Befóre it you cléared the gróund;
it took róot and fílled the lánd.

11 The móuntains were cóvered with its shádow,
the cédars of Gód with its bóughs.
12 It strétched out its bránches to the séa;
to the Ríver it strétched out its shóots.

13 Then whý have you bróken down its wálls?
It is plúcked by all who páss by the wáy.
14 It is rávaged by the bóar of the fórest,
devóured by the béasts of the fíeld.

15 God of hósts, turn agáin, we implóre;
look dówn from héaven and sée.

Vísit this víne and protéct it,
16 the víne your right hánd has plánted,
the son of mán you have cláimed for yoursélf.
17 They have búrnt it with fíre and cut it dówn.
May they pérish at the frówn of your fáce.

18 May your hánd be on the mán at your right hánd,
the son of mán you have confírmed as your ówn.
19 And we shall néver forsáke you agáin;
give us lífe that we may cáll upon your náme.

20  O Lórd God of hósts, bríng us báck;
let your fáce shine fórth, and wé shall be sáved.
