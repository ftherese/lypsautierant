Psalm 101

1 I sing of merciful love and justice;
I raise a psalm to you, O Lord.
2 I will ponder the way of the blameless. 
O when will you come to me?

I will walk with blameless heart
within my house;
3 I will not set before my eyes
whatever is base.

I hate the deeds of the crooked;
I will have none of it.
4 The false-hearted must keep far away;
I will know no evil.

5 Whoever slanders a neighbor in secret
I will bring to silence.
Proud eyes and haughty heart
I will never endure.

6 My eyes are on the faithful of the land,
that they may dwell with me.
The one who walks in the way of the blameless
shall be my servant.

7 No one who practices deceit
shall live within my house.
One who utters lies
shall not stand before my eyes.

8 Morning by morning I will destroy
all the wicked in the land,
uprooting from the city of the Lord
all who do evil.

Now and forever. Amen.
