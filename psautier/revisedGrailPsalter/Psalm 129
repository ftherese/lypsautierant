Psalm 129

1 ``They have préssed me hárd from my yóuth,"
let Ísrael síng.
2 ``They have préssed me hárd from my yóuth,
but could néver overcóme me.

3 The plówmen plówed my báck,
dráwing long fúrrows.
4 Yet the LÓRD, who is júst, has destróyed
the yóke of the wícked."

5 Lét them be shámed and róuted,
all thóse who hate Síon!
6 Lét them be like gráss on the róof,
that wíthers befóre it flówers.

7 With thát no réaper fills his hánds,
no bínder of shéaves his árms.
8 And thóse passing bý will not sáy,
``The bléssing of the LÓRD be upón you!"
We bléss you in the náme of the LÓRD!
