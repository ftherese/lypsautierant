Psalm 129

1 “They have pressed me hard from my youth,”
let Israel sing.
2 “They have pressed me hard from my youth,
but could never overcome me.

3 The plowmen plowed my back,
drawing long furrows.
4 Yet the LORD, who is just, has destroyed
the yoke of the wicked.”

5 Let them be shamed and routed,
all those who hate Sion!
6 Let them be like grass on the roof,
that withers before it flowers.

7 With that no reaper fills his hands,
no binder of sheaves his arms.
8 And those passing by will not say,
“The blessing of the LORD be upon you!”
We bless you in the name of the LORD!
