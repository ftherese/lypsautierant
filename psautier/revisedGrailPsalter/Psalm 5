Psalm 5

2 To my wórds give éar, O Lórd;
give héed to my síghs.
3 Atténd to the sóund of my crý,
my Kíng and my Gód.

4 To yóu do I práy, O Lórd.
In the mórning you héar my vóice;
in the mórning I pléad and watch befóre you.

5 You are no Gód who delíghts in évil;
no sínner is your gúest.
6 The bóastful shall not stánd their gróund
befóre your éyes.

7 Áll who do évil you despíse;
all who líe you destróy.
The déceitful and thóse who shed blóod,
the Lórd detésts.

8 Yet through the gréatness of your mérciful lóve,
I énter your hóuse.
I bow dówn before your hóly témple,
in áwe of yóu.

9 Léad me, Lórd, in your jústice,
becáuse of my fóes;
make stráight your wáy befóre me.

10 No trúth can be fóund in their móuths,
their héart is all málice,
their thróat a wíde-open gráve;
with their tóngue they flátter.

11 Decláre them gúilty, O Gód.
Let them fáil in their desígns.
Drive them óut for their mány transgréssions,
for against yóu have they rebélled.

12 All who take réfuge in yóu shall be glád,
and ever crý out their jóy.
You shélter them; in yóu they rejóice,
those who lóve your náme.
13 It is yóu who bless the júst one, O Lórd;
you surróund him with your fávor like a shíeld.
