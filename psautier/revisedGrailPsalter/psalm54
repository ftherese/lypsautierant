Psalm 54

3 O God, save me by your name;
by your power, defend my cause.
4 O God, hear my prayer;
give ear to the words of my mouth.

5 For the proud have risen against me,
and the ruthless seek my life.
They have no regard for God.

6 See, I have God for my help.
The Lord sustains my soul.
7 Let evil recoil on my foes.
In your faithfulness, bring them to an end.

8 I will sacrifice to you with willing heart,
and praise your name, for it is good:
9 for it has rescued me from all distress,
and my eyes have gazed upon my foes.

Now and forever. Amen.
