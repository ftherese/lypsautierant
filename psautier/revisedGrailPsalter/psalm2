Psalm 2

1 Why do the nations conspire,
and the peoples plot in vain?
2 They arise, the kings of the earth;
princes plot against the Lord and his Anointed.
3 “Let us burst asunder their fetters.
Let us cast off from us their chains.”

4 He who sits in the heavens laughs;
the Lord derides and mocks them.
5 Then he will speak in his anger,
his rage will strike them with terror.
6 “It is I who have appointed my king
on Sion, my holy mountain.”

7 I will announce the decree of the Lord:
The Lord said to me, “You are my Son.
It is I who have begotten you this day.

8 Ask of me and I will give you
the nations as your inheritance,
and the ends of the earth as your possession.
9 With a rod of iron you will rule them;
like a potter’s jar you will shatter them.”

10 So now, O kings, understand;
take warning, rulers of the earth.
11 Serve the Lord with fear;
exult with trembling, pay him your homage,
12 lest he be angry and you perish on the way,
for suddenly his anger will blaze.

Blessed are all who trust in God!

Now and forever. Amen.
