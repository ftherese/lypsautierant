Psalm 23

1 The Lórd is my shépherd;
there is nóthing I shall wánt.
2 Frésh and gréen are the pástures
where he gíves me repóse.
Near réstful wáters he léads me;
3 he revíves my sóul.

He guídes me alóng the right páth,
for the sáke of his náme.
4 Though I should wálk in the válley of the shádow of déath,
no évil would I féar, for you are wíth me.
Your cróok and your stáff will give me cómfort.

5 You have prepáred a táble befóre me
in the síght of my fóes.
My héad you have anóinted with óil;
my cúp is overflówing.

6 Surely góodness and mércy shall fóllow me
all the dáys of my lífe.
In the Lórd’s own hóuse shall I dwéll
for léngth of days unénding.
