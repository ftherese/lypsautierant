Psalm 93

1 The Lord is kíng, with májesty enróbed.
The Lord has róbed himsélf with míght;
he has gírded himsélf with pówer.

The wórld you made fírm, not to be móved;
2 your thróne has stood fírm from of óld.
From all etérnity, O Lórd, you áre.

3 The flóods have lífted up, O Lórd,
the flóods have lífted up their vóice;
the flóods have lífted up their thúnder.

4 Gréater than the róar of mighty wáters,
more glórious than the súrgings of the séa,
the Lórd is glórious on hígh.

5 Trúly your decrées are to be trústed.
Hóliness is fítting to your hóuse,
O Lórd, until the énd of tíme.
