Psalm 50

1 The Gód of góds, the Lórd,
has spóken and súmmoned the éarth,
from the rísing of the sún to its sétting.
2 Out of Síon, the perféction of béauty,
Gód is shíning fórth.

3 Our God cómes, and does nót keep sílence.
Befóre him fíre devóurs;
aróund him témpest ráges.
4 He cálls on the héavens abóve,
and on the éarth, to júdge his péople.

5 ``Gáther my hóly ones to mé,
who made cóvenant with mé by sácrifice."
6 The héavens procláim his jústice,
for hé, Gód, is the júdge.

7 ``Lísten, my péople, I will spéak;
Ísrael, I will téstify agáinst you,
for Í am Gód, your Gód.

8 I do nót rebúke you for your sácrifices;
your ófferings are álways befóre me.
9 I do not táke more búllocks from your fárms,
nor góats from amóng your hérds.

10 For I ówn all the béasts of the fórest,
béasts in their thóusands on my hílls.
11 I knów all the bírds on the móuntains;
all that móves in the fíeld belongs to mé.

12 Were I húngry, I would not téll you,
for the wórld and its fúllness is míne.
13 Do I éat the flésh of búlls,
or drínk the blóod of góats?

14 Give your práise as a sácrifice to Gód,
and fulfíll your vóws to the Most Hígh.
15 Then call on mé in the dáy of distréss.
I will delíver you and yóu shall hónor me."

16 But Gód will sáy to the wícked,
``Hów can you recíte my commándments,
and táke my cóvenant on your líps,
17 yóu who despíse corréction,
and cást my wórds behínd you,

18 Yóu who see a thíef and befríend him,
who thrów in your lót with adúlterers,
19 who unbrídle your móuth for évil,
and yóke your tóngue to decéit,
20  you who sít and malígn your own bróther,
and slánder your own móther’s són?

21 You do thís, and should Í keep sílence?
Do you thínk that Í am like yóu?
I accúse you, lay the chárge befóre you.

22 Mark this, yóu who are forgétful of Gód,
lest I séize you and nóne can delíver you.
23 A sácrifice of práise gives me hónor,
and to óne whose wáy is blámeless,
I will shów the salvátion of Gód."
