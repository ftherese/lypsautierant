Psalm 8

2 O Lord, our Lord, how majestic
is your name through all the earth!
Your majesty is set above the heavens.
3 From the mouths of children and of babes
you fashioned praise to foil your enemy,
to silence the foe and the rebel.

4 When I see the heavens, the work of your fingers,
the moon and the stars which you arranged,
5 what is man that you should keep him in mind,
the son of man that you care for him?

6 Yet you have made him little lower than the angels;
with glory and honor you crowned him,
7 gave him power over the works of your hands:
you put all things under his feet,

8 All of them, sheep and oxen,
yes, even the cattle of the fields,
9 birds of the air, and fish of the sea
that make their way through the waters.
10 O Lord, our Lord, how majestic
is your name through all the earth!

Now and forever. Amen.
