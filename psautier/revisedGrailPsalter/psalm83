Psalm 83

2 O God, do not be silent;
do not be still and unmoved, O God.
3 For your enemies raise a tumult;
those who hate you lift up their heads.

4 They plot against your people,
conspire against those you cherish.
5 They say, “Come, let us destroy them as a nation;
let not the name of Israel be remembered.”

6 They conspire with a single mind;
against you they make a covenant:
7 the camps of Edom and of Ishmael,
of Moab and Hagar,

8 Gebal and Ammon and Amalek,
Philistia, with the people of Tyre.
9 Assyria, too, is their ally,
and joins hands with the children of Lot.

10 Treat them like Midian, like Sisera,
like Jabin at the River Kishon,
11 those who were destroyed at Endor,
whose bodies rotted on the ground.

12 Make their captains like Oreb and Zeeb,
all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
13 the men who said, “Let us take
the fields of God for ourselves.”

14 My God, scatter them like the whirlwind,
drive them like chaff in the wind!
15 As fire that burns away the forest,
as the flame that sets the mountains ablaze,
16 drive them away with your tempest,
and fill them with terror at your storm.

17 Cover their faces with shame,
so that they seek your name, O Lord.
18 Shame and terror be theirs forever.
Let them be disgraced; let them perish!

19 Let them know that you alone,
you whose name is the Lord,
are the Most High over all the earth.

Now and forever. Amen.
