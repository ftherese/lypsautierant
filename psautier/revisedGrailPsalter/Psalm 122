Psalm 122

1 I rejóiced when they sáid to mé,
``Let us gó to the hóuse of the LÓRD."
2 And nów our féet are stánding
withín your gátes, O Jerúsalem.

3 Jerúsalem is buílt as a cíty
bonded as óne togéther.
4 It is thére that the tríbes go úp,
the tríbes of the LÓRD.

For Ísrael’s wítness it ís
to práise the náme of the LÓRD.
5 Thére were set the thrónes for júdgment,
the thrónes of the hóuse of Dávid.

6 For the péace of Jerúsalem práy,
``May they prósper, thóse who lóve you."
7 May péace abíde in your wálls,
and secúrity bé in your tówers.

8 For the sáke of my fámily and fríends,
let me sáy, ``Péace upon yóu."
9 For the sáke of the hóuse of the LÓRD, our Gód,
I will séek good thíngs for yóu.
