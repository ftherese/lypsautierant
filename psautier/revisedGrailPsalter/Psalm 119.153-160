Psalm 119:153-160

153 See my affliction and deliver me,
for I do not forget your law.
154 Uphold my cause and defend me;
by your promise, give me life.

155 Salvation is far from the wicked,
who are heedless of your statutes.
156 Numberless, LORD, are your mercies;
in your justice, give me life.

157 Though my foes and oppressors are countless,
I have not swerved from your decrees.
158 I look at the faithless with disgust;
they have not kept your word.

159 See how I love your precepts, O LORD!
In your mercy, give me life.
160 Truth is the sum of your word;
all your just judgments are eternal.
