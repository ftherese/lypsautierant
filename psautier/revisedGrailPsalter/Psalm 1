Psalm 1

1 Bléssed indéed is the mán
who fóllows not the cóunsel of the wícked,
nor stánds in the páth with sínners,
nor abídes in the cómpany of scórners,
2 but whose delíght is the láw of the Lórd,
and who pónders his láw day and níght.

3 Hé is like a trée that is plánted
besíde the flówing wáters,
that yíelds its frúit in due séason,
and whose léaves shall néver fáde;
and áll that he dóes shall prósper.

4 Not só are the wícked, not só!
For théy, like wínnowed cháff,
shall be dríven awáy by the wínd.

5 When the wícked are júdged they shall not ríse,
nor shall sínners in the cóuncil of the júst;
6 for the Lórd knows the wáy of the júst,
but the wáy of the wícked will pérish.
