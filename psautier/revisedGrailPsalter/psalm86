Psalm 86

1 Turn your ear, O Lord, and answer me,
for I am poor and needy.
2 Preserve my soul, for I am faithful;
save the servant who trusts in you, my God.

3 Have mercy on me, O Lord,
for I cry to you all the day long.
4 Gladden the soul of your servant,
for I lift up my soul to you, O Lord.

5 O Lord, you are good and forgiving,
full of mercy to all who call to you.
6 Give ear, O Lord, to my prayer,
and attend to my voice in supplication.

7 In the day of distress, I will call to you,
and surely you will answer me.
8 Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord,
nor works to compare with yours.

9 All the nations you have made shall come;
they will bow down before you, O Lord,
and glorify your name,
10 for you are great and do marvelous deeds,
you who alone are God.

11 Teach me, O Lord, your way,
so that I may walk in your truth,
single-hearted to fear your name.

12 I will praise you, Lord my God, with all my heart,
and glorify your name forever.
13 Your mercy to me has been great;
you have saved me from the depths of the grave.

14 The proud have risen against me, O God;
a band of the ruthless seeks my life.
To you they pay no heed.

15 But you, O God, are compassionate and gracious,
slow to anger, O Lord,
abundant in mercy and fidelity;
16 turn and take pity on me.

O give your strength to your servant,
and save the son of your handmaid.
17 Show me the sign of your favor,
that my foes may see to their shame
that you, O Lord, give me comfort and help.

Now and forever. Amen.
