Psalm 53

2 The fool has said in his heart,
“There is no God.”
Their deeds are corrupt, depraved;
no one does any good.

3 God looks down from heaven
on the human race,
to see if any are wise,
if any seek God.

4 All have left the right path,
depraved, every one;
there is no one who does any good,
no, not even one.

5 Do none who do evil understand?
They eat up my people as if eating bread;
they never call out to God.

6 There they shall tremble with fear—
without cause for fear—
for God scatters the bones of your besiegers.
They are shamed; God rejects them.

7 Who will bring Israel salvation from Sion?
When God brings about the return of his people,
then Jacob will be glad and Israel rejoice.

Now and forever. Amen.
