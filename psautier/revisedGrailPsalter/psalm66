Psalm 66

1 Cry out with joy to God, all the earth;
2 O sing to the glory of his name.
O render him glorious praise.
3 Say to God, “How awesome your deeds!

Because of the greatness of your strength,
your enemies fawn upon you.
4 Before you all the earth shall bow down,
shall sing to you, sing to your name!”

5 Come and see the works of God:
awesome his deeds among the children of men.
6 He turned the sea into dry land;
they passed through the river on foot.

Let our joy, then, be in him;
7 he rules forever by his might.
His eyes keep watch on the nations:
let rebels not exalt themselves.

8 O peoples, bless our God;
let the voice of his praise resound,
9 of the God who gave life to our souls
and kept our feet from stumbling.

10 For you, O God, have tested us,
you have tried us as silver is tried;
11 you led us, God, into the snare;
you laid a heavy burden on our backs.

12 You let men ride over our heads;
we went through fire and through water,
but then you brought us to a place of plenty.

13 Burnt offering I bring to your house;
to you I will pay my vows,
14 the vows which my lips have uttered,
which my mouth declared in my distress.

15 I will offer you burnt offerings of fatlings
with the smoke of sacrificial rams.
I will offer bullocks and goats.

16 Come and hear, all who fear God;
I will tell what he did for my soul.
17 To him I cried aloud,
with exaltation ready on my tongue.

18 Had I considered evil in my heart,
the Lord would not have listened.
19 But truly God has listened;
he has heeded the voice of my prayer.
20  Blest be God, who did not reject my prayer,
nor withhold from me his merciful love.

Now and forever. Amen.
