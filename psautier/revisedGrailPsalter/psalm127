Psalm 119:57-64

57 I have said, “O Lord, my portion
is to obey your words.”
58 With all my heart I implore your favor;
as with your promise, have mercy.

59 I have pondered my ways,
and turned my steps to your decrees.
60  I made haste; I did not delay
to obey your commands.

61 Though the nets of the wicked ensnare me,
your law I did not forget.
62 At midnight I will rise and thank you
for your just decrees.

63 I am a friend of all who revere you,
who keep your precepts.
64 O Lord, your merciful love fills the earth.
Teach me your statutes.

Now and forever. Amen.
