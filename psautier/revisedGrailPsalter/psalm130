Psalm 119:81-88

81 My soul yearns for your salvation;
I hope in your word.
82 My eyes yearn to see your promise.
I ask, “When will you comfort me?”

83 I am like a wineskin shriveled by smoke,
yet I remember your statutes.
84 How long must your servant endure?
When will you bring judgment on my foes?

85 For me the proud have dug pitfalls;
they defy your law.
86 Your commands are all true; then help me
when lies oppress me.

87 They have almost made an end of me on earth,
yet I forsake not your precepts.
88 In your merciful love, give me life;
I will obey the decrees of your lips.

Now and forever. Amen.
