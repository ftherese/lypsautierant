Psalm 62

2 In God alone is my soul at rest;
my salvation comes from him.
3 He alone is my rock, my salvation,
my fortress; never shall I falter.

4 How long will you all attack one man
to break him down,
as though he were a tottering wall,
or a tumbling fence?

5 Their plan is only to bring down;
they take pleasure in lies.
With their mouth they utter blessing,
but in their heart they curse.

6 In God alone be at rest, my soul,
for my hope is from him.
7 He alone is my rock, my salvation,
my fortress; never shall I falter.

8 In God is my salvation and glory,
my rock of strength;
in God is my refuge.
9 Trust him at all times, O people.
Pour out your hearts before him,
for God is our refuge.

10 The sons of men are a breath,
an illusion, the sons of men.
Placed in the scales, they rise;
they all weigh less than a breath.

11 Do not put your trust in oppression,
nor vain hopes on plunder.
Even if riches increase,
set not your heart on them.

12 For God has said only one thing;
only two have I heard:
that to God alone belongs power,
13 and to you, Lord, merciful love;
and that you repay each man
according to his deeds.

Now and forever. Amen.
