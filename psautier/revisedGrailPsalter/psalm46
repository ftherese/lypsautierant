Psalm 46

2 God is for us a refuge and strength,
an ever-present help in time of distress:
3 so we shall not fear though the earth should rock,
though the mountains quake to the heart of the sea;
4 even though its waters rage and foam,
even though the mountains be shaken by its tumult.

The Lord of hosts is with us:
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.

5 The waters of a river give joy to God’s city,
the holy place, the dwelling of the Most High.
6 God is within, it cannot be shaken;
God will help it at the dawning of the day.
7 Nations are in tumult, kingdoms are shaken:
he lifts his voice, the earth melts away.

8 The Lord of hosts is with us:
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.

9 Come and behold the works of the Lord,
the awesome deeds he has done on the earth.
10 He puts an end to wars over all the earth;
the bow he breaks, the spear he snaps, the shields he burns with fire:
11 “Be still and know that I am God,
exalted over nations, exalted over earth!”

12 The Lord of hosts is with us:
the God of Jacob is our stronghold.

Now and forever. Amen.
