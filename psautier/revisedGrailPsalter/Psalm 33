Psalm 33

1 Ring out your jóy to the Lórd, O you júst;
for práise is fítting for the úpright.
2 Give thánks to the Lórd upon the hárp;
with a tén-stringed lúte sing him sóngs.
3 O síng him a sóng that is néw;
play skíllfully, with shóuts of jóy.

4 For the wórd of the Lórd is fáithful,
and áll his wórks to be trústed.
5 The Lórd loves jústice and ríght,
and his mérciful lóve fills the éarth.

6 By the wórd of the Lórd the héavens were máde,
by the bréath of his móuth all their hóst.
7 As in a flásk, he collécts the wáves of the ócean;
he stóres up the dépths of the séa.

8 Let áll the earth féar the Lórd,
all who líve in the wórld revére him.
9 He spóke, and it cáme to bé.
He commánded; it stóod in pláce.

10 The Lord frústrates the desígns of the nátions;
he deféats the pláns of the péoples.
11 The desígns of the Lórd stand foréver,
the pláns of his héart from age to áge.

12 Blessed the nátion whose Gód is the Lórd,
the péople he has chósen as his héritage.
13 From the héavens the Lórd looks fórth;
he sées all the chíldren of mén.

14 From the pláce where he dwélls he gázes
on áll the dwéllers on the éarth,
15 he who shápes the héarts of them áll,
and consíders áll their déeds.

16 A kíng is not sáved by his great ármy,
nor a wárrior presérved by his great stréngth.
17 A vain hópe for sáfety is the hórse;
despite its pówer it cánnot sáve.

18 Yes, the Lord’s éyes are on thóse who féar him,
who hópe in his mérciful lóve,
19 to réscue their sóuls from déath,
to kéep them alíve in fámine.

20  Our sóul is wáiting for the Lórd.
Hé is our hélp and our shíeld.
21 In hím do our héarts find jóy.
We trúst in his hóly náme.
22 May your mérciful lóve be upón us,
as we hópe in yóu, O Lórd.
