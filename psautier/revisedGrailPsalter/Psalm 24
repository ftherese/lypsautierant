Psalm 24

1 The Lordâ€™s is the earth and its fullness,
the world, and those who dwell in it.
2 It is he who set it on the seas;
on the rivers he made it firm.

3 Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?
Who shall stand in his holy place?
4 The clean of hands and pure of heart,
whose soul is not set on vain things,
who has not sworn deceitful words.

5 Blessings from the Lord shall he receive,
and right reward from the God who saves him.
6 Such are the people who seek him,
who seek the face of the God of Jacob.

7 O gates, lift high your heads;
grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!

8 Who is this king of glory?
The Lord, the mighty, the valiant;
the Lord, the valiant in war.

9 O gates, lift high your heads;
grow higher, ancient doors.
Let him enter, the king of glory!

10 Who is this king of glory?
He, the Lord of hosts,
he is the king of glory.
