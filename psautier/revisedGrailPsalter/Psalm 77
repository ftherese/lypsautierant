Psalm 77

2 I cry alóud to Gód,
cry alóud to Gód that he may héar me.

3 In the dáy of my distréss I seek the Lórd.
In the níght my hands are ráised unwéaried;
my sóul refúses cómfort.
4 As I remémber my Gód, I gróan.
I pónder, and my spírit fáints.

5 You kéep my éyes from clósing.
I am tróubled, unáble to spéak.
6 I thínk of the dáys of long agó,
and remémber the yéars long pást.
7 At níght I múse within my héart.
I pónder, and my spírit quéstions.

8 ``Will the Lórd rejéct us foréver?
Will he shów us his fávor no móre?
9 Has his mércy vánished foréver?
Has his prómise cóme to an énd?
10 Has Gód forgótten his mércy,
or in ánger withdráwn his compássion?"

11 I said, ``Thís is what cáuses my gríef:
that the right hánd of the Most Hígh has chánged."
12 I remémber the déeds of the Lórd,
I remémber your wónders of óld;
13 I múse on áll your wórks,
and pónder your míghty déeds.

14 Your wáy, O Gód, is in the hóly place. 
What gód is as gréat as our Gód?
15 Yóu are the Gód who works wónders.
Among the péoples you shówed your pówer.
16 Your strong árm redéemed your péople,
the descéndants of Jácob and Jóseph.

17 The wáters sáw you, O Gód,
the wáters sáw you and ánguished.
Yes, the dépths were móved to trémble.
18 The clóuds poured dówn with ráin.
The skíes sent fórth their vóice;
Your árrows fláshed to and fró.

19 Your thúnderous vóice was in the whírlwind;
your fláshes líghted up the wórld.
The éarth was móved and trémbled.
20  Your wáy was thróugh the séa,
your páth through the míghty wáters,
but the tráce of your stéps was not séen.

21 You guíded your péople like a flóck
by the hánd of Móses and Áaron.
