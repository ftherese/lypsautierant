Psalm 116A

1 I love the Lord, for he has heard
my voice, my appeal;
2 for he has turned his ear to me
whenever I call.

3 They surrounded me, the snares of death;
the anguish of the grave has found me;
anguish and sorrow I found.
4 I called on the name of the Lord:
“Deliver my soul, O Lord!”

5 How gracious is the Lord, and just;
our God has compassion.
6 The Lord protects the simple;
I was brought low, and he saved me.

7 Turn back, my soul, to your rest,
for the Lord has been good to you;
8 he has kept my soul from death,
my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
9 I will walk in the presence of the Lord
in the land of the living.

Now and forever. Amen.
