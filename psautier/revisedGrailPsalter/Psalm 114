Psalm 114

When Ísrael came fórth from Égypt,
the house of Jácob from a fóreign péople,
2 Júdah becáme his témple,
Ísrael becáme his domáin.

3 The séa behéld them and fléd;
the Jórdan turned báck on its cóurse.
4 The móuntains léapt like ráms,
and the hílls like yéarling shéep.

5 Whý was it, séa, that you fléd;
that you túrned back, Jórdan, on your cóurse?
6 O móuntains, that you léapt like ráms;
O hílls, like yéarling shéep?

7 Trémble, O éarth, before the Lórd,
in the présence of the Gód of Jácob,
8 who túrns the róck into a póol,
and flínt into a spríng of wáter.
