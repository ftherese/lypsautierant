Psalm 34

2 I will bless the Lord at all times;
praise of him is always in my mouth.
3 In the Lord my soul shall make its boast;
the humble shall hear and be glad.

4 Glorify the Lord with me;
together let us praise his name.
5 I sought the Lord, and he answered me;
from all my terrors he set me free.

6 Look toward him and be radiant;
let your faces not be abashed.
7 This lowly one called; the Lord heard,
and rescued him from all his distress.

8 The angel of the Lord is encamped
around those who fear him, to rescue them.
9 Taste and see that the Lord is good.
Blessed the man who seeks refuge in him.

10 Fear the Lord, you his holy ones.
They lack nothing, those who fear him.
11 The rich suffer want and go hungry,
but those who seek the Lord lack no blessing.

12 Come, children, and hear me,
that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.
13 Who is it that desires life
and longs to see prosperous days?

14 Guard your tongue from evil,
and your lips from speaking deceit.
15 Turn aside from evil and do good.
Seek after peace, and pursue it.

16 The Lord turns his eyes to the just,
and his ears are open to their cry.
17 The Lord turns his face against the wicked
to destroy their remembrance from the earth.

18 When the just cry out, the Lord hears,
and rescues them in all their distress.
19 The Lord is close to the brokenhearted;
those whose spirit is crushed he will save.

20  Many are the trials of the just man,
but from them all the Lord will rescue him.
21 He will keep guard over all his bones;
not one of his bones shall be broken.

22 Evil brings death to the wicked;
those who hate the just man are doomed.
23 The Lord ransoms the souls of his servants.
All who trust in him shall not be condemned.

Now and forever. Amen.
