Psalm 126

1 When the LÓRD brought back the éxiles of Síon,
we thóught we were dréaming.
2 Thén was our móuth filled with láughter;
on our tóngues, songs of jóy.

Then the nátions themselves sáid, ``What great déeds
the LÓRD worked for thém!"
3 What great déeds the LÓRD worked for ús!
Indéed, we were glád.

4 Bring báck our éxiles, O LÓRD,
as stréams in the sóuth.
5 Thóse who are sówing in téars
will síng when they réap.

6 They go óut, they go óut, full of téars,
bearing séed for the sówing;
they come báck, they come báck with a sóng,
béaring their shéaves.
