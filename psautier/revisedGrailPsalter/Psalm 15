Psalm 15

1 Lord, whó may abíde in your tént,
and dwéll on your hóly móuntain?
2 Whoéver wálks without fáult;
who dóes what is júst,
and spéaks the trúth from his héart.

3 Whoéver does not slánder with his tóngue,
who dóes no wróng to a néighbor,
who cásts no slúr on a fríend,
4 who lóoks with scórn on the wícked,
but hónors those who féar the Lórd.

Who keeps an óath, whatéver the cóst,
5 who lénds no móney at ínterest,
and accépts no bríbes against the ínnocent.
Such a óne shall néver be sháken.
