Psalm 120

1 To the LÓRD in the hóur of my distréss
I cáll—and he ánswers me.
2 ``O LÓRD, save my sóul from lying líps,
from the tóngue of the decéitful."

3 What should he gíve you, whát repáy you,
O decéitful tóngue?
4 The wárrior’s árrows shárpened,
with red-hot cóals from the bróom tree!

5 Alás, that I líve in Méshech,
dwell among the ténts of Kédar!
6 Í have had enóugh of dwélling
with thóse who hate péace.
7 Í am for péace, but when I spéak,
théy are for wár.
