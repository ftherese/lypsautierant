Psalm 63

2 O God, you are my God; at dawn I seek you;
for you my soul is thirsting.
For you my flesh is pining,
like a dry, weary land without water.
3 I have come before you in the sanctuary,
to behold your strength and your glory.

4 Your loving mercy is better than life;
my lips will speak your praise.
5 I will bless you all my life;
in your name I will lift up my hands.
6 My soul shall be filled as with a banquet;
with joyful lips, my mouth shall praise you.

7 When I remember you upon my bed,
I muse on you through the watches of the night.
8 For you have been my strength;
in the shadow of your wings I rejoice.
9 My soul clings fast to you;
your right hand upholds me.

10 Those who seek to destroy my life
shall go down to the depths of the earth.
11 Put to the power of the sword,
they shall be left as prey for the jackals.

12 But the king shall rejoice in God;
all that swear by him shall exult,
for the mouth of liars shall be silenced.

Now and forever. Amen.
