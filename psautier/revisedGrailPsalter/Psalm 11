Psalm 11

1 In the Lórd I have táken réfuge.
Hów can you sáy to my sóul,
``Flý like a bírd to the móuntain!

2 Look, the wícked are bénding their bów!
They are fíxing their árrow on the stríng,
to shoot the úpright of héart in the dárk.
3 Foundátions ónce destróyed,
whát can the júst man dó?"

4 The Lórd is in his hóly témple;
the thróne of the Lórd is in héaven.
His éyes behóld the wórld;
his gáze probes the chíldren of mén.

5 The Lord inspécts the júst and the wícked;
the lóver of víolence he hátes.
6 He sends fíre and brímstone on the wícked,
a scorching wínd to fíll their cúp.
7 For the Lord is júst and lóves deeds of jústice;
the úpright shall behóld his fáce.
