Psalm 119:89-96

89 Forever is your word, O Lord,
standing firm in the heavens.
90  From age to age is your truth;
like the earth, it stands firm.

91 Your judgments endure to this day,
for all things are your servants.
92 Had your law not been my delight,
I would have died in my affliction.

93 I will never forget your precepts,
for with them you give me life.
94 Save me, I am yours,
for I seek your precepts.

95 Though the wicked lie in wait to destroy me,
yet I ponder your decrees.
96 I have seen that all perfection has an end,
but your command is boundless.

Now and forever. Amen.
