Psalm 96

1 O síng a new sóng to the Lórd;
síng to the Lórd, all the éarth.
2 O síng to the Lórd; bless his náme.
Procláim his salvátion day by dáy.
3 Téll among the nátions his glóry,
and his wónders amóng all the péoples.

4 For the Lórd is great and híghly to be práised,
to be féared abóve all góds.
5 For the góds of the nátions are náught.
It was the Lórd who máde the héavens.
6 In his présence are májesty and spléndor,
stréngth and hónor in his hóly place.

7 Give the Lórd, you fámilies of péoples,
gíve the Lord glóry and pówer;
8 give the Lórd the glóry of his náme.

Bring an óffering and énter his cóurts;
9 wórship the Lórd in holy spléndor.
O trémble befóre him, all the éarth.

10 Say to the nátions, ``The Lórd is kíng."
The wórld he made fírm in its pláce;
he will júdge the péoples in fáirness.

11 Let the héavens rejóice and earth be glád;
let the séa and all withín it thunder práise.
12 Let the lánd and all it béars rejóice.

Then will all the trées of the wóod shout for jóy
13 at the présence of the Lórd, for he cómes,
he cómes to júdge the éarth.
He will júdge the wórld with jústice;
he will góvern the péoples with his trúth.
