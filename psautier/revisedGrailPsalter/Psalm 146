Psalm 146

1 Alleluia!

My sóul, give práise to the LÓRD;
2 I will práise the LÓRD all my lífe,
sing práise to my Gód while I líve.

3 Pút no trúst in prínces,
in mortal mán who cánnot sáve.
4 Take their bréath, they retúrn to the éarth,
and their pláns that dáy come to nóthing.

5 Blessed is hé who is hélped by Jacob’s Gód,
whose hópe is in the LÓRD his Gód,
6 who máde the héavens and the éarth,
the séas and áll they contáin,
who presérves fidélity foréver,
7 who does jústice to thóse who are oppréssed.

It is hé who gives bréad to the húngry,
the LÓRD who sets prísoners frée,
8 the LORD who ópens the éyes of the blínd,
the LORD who ráises up thóse who are bowed dówn.

It is the LÓRD who lóves the júst,
9 the LÓRD who protécts the stránger
and uphólds the órphan and the wídow,
but thwárts the páth of the wícked.
10 The LÓRD will réign foréver,
the God of Síon from áge to áge.

Alleluia!
