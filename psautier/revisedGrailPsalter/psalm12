Psalm 12

2 Save me, O Lord, for the holy ones are no more;
the faithful have vanished from the sons of men.
3 They babble vanities, one to another,
with cunning lips, with divided heart.

4 May the Lord destroy all cunning lips,
the tongue that utters boastful words,
5 those who say, “We prevail with our tongue;
our lips are our own, who is our master?”

6 “For the poor who are oppressed and the needy who groan,
now will I arise,” says the Lord;
“I will grant them the salvation for which they long.”
7 The words of the Lord are words without alloy,
silver from the furnace, seven times refined.

8 It is you, O Lord, who will keep us safe,
and protect us forever from this generation.
9 The wicked prowl on every side,
while baseness is exalted by the sons of men.

Now and forever. Amen.
