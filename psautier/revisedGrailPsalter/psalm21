Psalm 21

2 In your strength, O Lord, the king rejoices;
how greatly your salvation makes him glad!
3 You have granted him his heartâ€™s desire;
you have not withheld the prayer of his lips.

4 You came to meet him with blessings of prosperity;
you have set on his head a crown of pure gold. 
5 He asked you for life and this you have given:
days that will last from age to age.

6 By your saving help great is his glory;
you have bestowed upon him majesty and splendor;
7 you have granted him blessings forever,
made him rejoice with the joy of your presence.

8 The king has placed his trust in the Lord.
Through the mercy of the Most High, he is unshaken.

9 Your hand will find out all your foes,
your right hand will find out those that hate you.
10 You will burn them like a blazing furnace
on the day when you appear,
and the Lord will consume them in his anger:
fire will swallow them up.

11 You will wipe out their descendants from the earth,
and their offspring from the human race.
12 Though they planned evil against you,
though they plotted, they shall not prevail.

13 For you will force them to retreat;
at them you will aim with your bow.
14 O Lord, arise in your strength;
we shall sing and praise your power.

Now and forever. Amen.
