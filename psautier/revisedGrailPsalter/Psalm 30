Psalm 30

2 I will extól you, Lórd, for you have ráised me úp,
and have nót let my énemies rejóice over mé.

3 O Lord my Gód, I críed to you for hélp,
and yóu have héaled me.
4 O Lórd, you have lífted up my sóul from the gráve,
restóred me to lífe from those who sínk into the pít.

5 Sing psálms to the Lórd, you fáithful ones;
give thánks to his hóly náme.
6 His ánger lasts a móment; his fávor all through lífe.
At níght come téars, but dáwn brings jóy.

7 I sáid to mysélf in my good fórtune:
``Í shall néver be sháken."
8 O Lord, your fávor had sét me like a móuntain strónghold.
Then you híd your fáce, and I was pút to confúsion.

9 To yóu, O Lórd, I críed,
to my Gód I appéaled for mércy:
10 ``What prófit is my lífeblood, my góing to the gráve?
Can dúst give you thánks, or procláim your fáithfulness?"

11 Hear, O Lórd, and have mércy on mé;
bé my hélper, O Lórd.
12 You have chánged my móurning into dáncing,
removed my sáckcloth and gírded me with jóy.
13 So my sóul sings psálms to you, and wíll not be sílent.
O Lórd my Gód, I will thánk you foréver.
