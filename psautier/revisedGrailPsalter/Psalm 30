Psalm 30

2 I will extol you, Lord, for you have raised me up,
and have not let my enemies rejoice over me.

3 O Lord my God, I cried to you for help,
and you have healed me.
4 O Lord, you have lifted up my soul from the grave,
restored me to life from those who sink into the pit.

5 Sing psalms to the Lord, you faithful ones;
give thanks to his holy name.
6 His anger lasts a moment; his favor all through life.
At night come tears, but dawn brings joy.

7 I said to myself in my good fortune:
``I shall never be shaken."
8 O Lord, your favor had set me like a mountain stronghold.
Then you hid your face, and I was put to confusion.

9 To you, O Lord, I cried,
to my God I appealed for mercy:
10 ``What profit is my lifeblood, my going to the grave?
Can dust give you thanks, or proclaim your faithfulness?"

11 Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me;
be my helper, O Lord.
12 You have changed my mourning into dancing,
removed my sackcloth and girded me with joy.
13 So my soul sings psalms to you, and will not be silent.
O Lord my God, I will thank you forever.
