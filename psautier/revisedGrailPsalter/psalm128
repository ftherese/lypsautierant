Psalm 119:65-72

65 O Lord, you have been good to your servant,
according to your word.
66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge,
for I trust in your commands.

67 Before I was humbled, I strayed,
but now I keep your word.
68 You are good, and you do what is good;
teach me your statutes.

69 The arrogant smear me with lies;
with all my heart I keep your precepts.
70  Their heart is dense like fat,
but your law is my delight.

71 It was good for me to be humbled,
that I might learn your statutes.
72 The law from your mouth means more to me
than large quantities of silver and gold.

Now and forever. Amen.
