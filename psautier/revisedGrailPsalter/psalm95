Psalm 95

1 Come, let us ring out our joy to the Lord;
hail the rock who saves us.
2 Let us come into his presence, giving thanks;
let us hail him with a song of praise.

3 A mighty God is the Lord,
a great king above all gods.
4 In his hands are the depths of the earth;
the heights of the mountains are his.
5 To him belongs the sea, for he made it,
and the dry land that he shaped by his hands.

6 O come; let us bow and bend low.
Let us kneel before the God who made us,
7 for he is our God and we
the people who belong to his pasture,
the flock that is led by his hand.

O that today you would listen to his voice!
8 “Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,
as on that day at Massah in the desert
9 when your forebears put me to the test;
when they tried me, though they saw my work.

10 For forty years I wearied of that generation,
and I said, ‘Their hearts are astray;
this people does not know my ways.’
11 Then I took an oath in my anger,
‘Never shall they enter my rest.’”

Now and forever. Amen.
