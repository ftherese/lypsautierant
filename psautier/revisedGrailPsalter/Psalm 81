Psalm 81

2 Sing jóyfully to Gód our stréngth,
shout in tríumph to the Gód of Jácob.
3 Raise a sóng and sóund the tímbrel,
the swéet-sounding hárp and the lúte;
4 blów the trúmpet at the néw moon,
when the móon is fúll, on our féast.

5 For thís is a státute in Ísrael,
a commánd of the Gód of Jácob.
6 He máde it a decrée for Jóseph,
when he went óut from the lánd of Égypt.

A vóice I did not knów said to mé:
7 ``I fréed your shóulder from the búrden;
your hands were fréed from the buílder’s básket.
8 You cálled in distréss and I delívered you.

I ánswered, concéaled in the thúnder;
at the wáters of Méribah I tésted you.
9 Lísten, my péople, as I wárn you.
O Ísrael, if ónly you would héed!

10 Let there bé no strange gód amóng you,
nor shall you wórship a fóreign gód.
11 Í am the Lórd your Gód,
who brought you úp from the lánd of Égypt.
Ópen wide your móuth, and I will fíll it.

12 But my péople did not héed my vóice,
and Ísrael would nót obéy me.
13 So I léft them in their stúbbornness of héart,
to fóllow their ówn desígns.

14 Ó that my péople would héed me,
that Ísrael would wálk in my wáys!
15 At ónce I would subdúe their fóes,
turn my hánd agáinst their énemies.

16 Those who háte the Lord would crínge befóre him,
and their subjéction would lást foréver.
17 But Ísrael I would féed with finest whéat,
and sátisfy with hóney from the róck."
