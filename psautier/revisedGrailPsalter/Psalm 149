Psalm 149

1 Alleluia!

Síng a new sóng to the LÓRD,
his práise in the assémbly of the fáithful.
2 Let Ísrael rejóice in its Máker;
let Sion’s chíldren exúlt in their kíng.
3 Let them práise his náme with dáncing,
and make músic with tímbrel and hárp.

4 For the LÓRD takes delíght in his péople;
he crówns the póor with salvátion.
5 Let the fáithful exúlt in glóry,
and rejóice as they táke their rést.
6 Let the práise of Gód be in their móuths
and a twó-edged swórd in their hánd,

7 To déal out véngeance to the nátions
and púnishment upón the péoples;
8 to bínd their kíngs in cháins
and their nóbles in fétters of íron;
9 to cárry out the júdgment decréed.
This is an hónor for áll his fáithful.

Alleluia!
