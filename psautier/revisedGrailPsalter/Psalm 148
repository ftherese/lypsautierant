Psalm 148

1 Alleluia!

Praise the LORD from the heavens;
praise him in the heights.
2 Praise him, all his angels;
praise him, all his hosts.

3 Praise him, sun and moon;
praise him, all shining stars.
4 Praise him, highest heavens,
and the waters above the heavens.

5 Let them praise the name of the LORD.
He commanded: they were created.
6 He established them forever and ever,
gave a law which shall not pass away.

7 Praise the LORD from the earth,
sea creatures and all ocean depths,
8 fire and hail, snow and mist,
stormy winds that fulfill his command;

9 Mountains and all hills,
fruit trees and all cedars,
10 beasts, both wild and tame,
reptiles and birds on the wing;

11 Kings of the earth and all peoples,
princes and all judges of the earth,
12 young men and maidens as well,
the old and the young together.

13 Let them praise the name of the LORD,
for his name alone is exalted,
his splendor above heaven and earth.

14 He exalts the strength of his people.
He is the praise of all his faithful,
the praise of the children of Israel,
of the people to whom he is close.

Alleluia!
