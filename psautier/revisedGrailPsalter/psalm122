Psalm 119:17-24

17 Deal bountifully with your servant,
that I may live and keep your word.
18 Open my eyes, that I may see
the wonders of your law.

19 I am a pilgrim in the land;
hide not your commands from me.
20  My soul is consumed with longing
at all times for your decrees.

21 You threaten the proud, the accursed,
who stray from your commands.
22 Free me from scorn and contempt,
for I observe your decrees.

23 Though princes sit plotting against me,
your servant ponders your statutes.
24 See, your decrees are my delight;
your statutes are my counselors.

Now and forever. Amen.
