Psalm 119:33-40

33 Lord, teach me the way of your statutes,
and I will keep them to the end.
34 Grant me insight that I may keep your law,
and observe it wholeheartedly.

35 Guide me in the path of your commands,
for in them is my delight.
36 Bend my heart to your decrees,
and not to wrongful gain.

37 Turn my eyes from gazing on vanities;
in your way, give me life.
38 Fulfill your promise to your servant,
that you may be revered.

39 Turn away the taunts I dread,
for your decrees are good.
40  See, I long for your precepts;
give me life by your justice.

Now and forever. Amen.
