Psalm 66

1 Cry out with jóy to Gód, all the éarth;
2 O síng to the glóry of his náme.
O rénder him glórious práise.
3 Say to Gód, ``How áwesome your déeds!

Becáuse of the gréatness of your stréngth,
your énemies fáwn upón you.
4 Before yóu all the éarth shall bow dówn,
shall síng to you, síng to your náme!"

5 Come and sée the wórks of Gód:
awesome his déeds among the chíldren of mén.
6 He túrned the séa into dry lánd;
they pássed through the ríver on fóot.

Let our jóy, then, bé in hím;
7 he rúles foréver by his míght.
His éyes keep wátch on the nátions:
let rébels not exált themsélves.

8 O péoples, bléss our Gód;
let the vóice of his práise resóund,
9 of the Gód who gave lífe to our sóuls
and képt our féet from stúmbling.

10 For yóu, O Gód, have tésted us,
you have tríed us as sílver is tríed;
11 you léd us, Gód, into the snáre;
you láid a heavy búrden on our bácks.

12 You lét men ríde over our héads;
we wént through fíre and through wáter,
but then you bróught us to a pláce of plénty.

13 Burnt óffering I bríng to your hóuse;
to yóu I will páy my vóws,
14 the vóws which my líps have úttered,
which my móuth decláred in my distréss.

15 I will óffer you burnt ófferings of fátlings
with the smóke of sácrificial ráms.
I will óffer búllocks and góats.

16 Come and héar, áll who fear Gód;
I will téll what he díd for my sóul.
17 To hím I críed alóud,
with exaltátion réady on my tóngue.

18 Had I consídered évil in my héart,
the Lórd would nót have lístened.
19 But trúly Gód has lístened;
he has héeded the vóice of my práyer.
20  Blest be Gód, who did nót reject my prayer,
nor withhóld from me his mérciful lóve.
