Psalm 143

1 O LORD, listen to my prayer;
turn your ear to my appeal.
You are faithful, you are just; give answer.
2 Do not call your servant to judgment,
for in your sight no one living is justified.

3 The enemy pursues my soul;
he has crushed my life to the ground.
He has made me dwell in darkness,
like the dead, long forgotten.
4 Therefore my spirit fails;
my heart is desolate within me.

5 I remember the days that are past;
I ponder all your works.
I muse on what your hand has wrought,
6 and to you I stretch out my hands.
Like a parched land my soul thirsts for you.

7 O LORD, make haste and answer me,
for my spirit fails within me.
Do not hide your face from me,
lest I become like those
who go down into the grave.

8 In the morning, let me know your loving mercy,
for in you I place my trust.
Make me know the way I should walk;
to you I lift up my soul.

9 Rescue me, O LORD, from my foes;
to you have I fled for refuge.
10 Teach me to do your will,
for you are my God.
Let your good spirit guide me
upon ground that is level.

11 LORD, save my life for the sake of your name;
in your justice, lead my soul out of distress.
12 In your mercy make an end of my foes;
destroy all those who oppress my soul,
for I am your servant.
