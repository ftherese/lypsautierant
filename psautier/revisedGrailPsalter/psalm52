Psalm 52

3 Why do you boast of wickedness,
you champion of evil?
4 Planning ruin all day long,
your tongue is like a sharpened razor,
you who practice deceit!

5 You love evil more than good,
falsehood more than truth.
6 You love every destructive word,
O tongue of deceit.

7 Then God will break you down forever,
and he will take you away.
He will snatch you from your tent, and uproot you
from the land of the living.

8 The just shall see and fear.
They shall laugh and say,
9 “So this is the champion who refused
to take God as a stronghold,
but trusted in the greatness of wealth
and grew powerful by wickedness.”

10 But I am like a growing olive tree
in the house of God.
I trust in the mercy of God,
forever and ever.

11 I will thank you forevermore,
for this is your doing.
I will hope in your name, for it is good,
in the presence of your faithful.

Now and forever. Amen.
