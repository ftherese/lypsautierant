Psalm 10

1 O Lórd, why do you stánd afar óff,
and híde yoursélf in tímes of distréss?
2 The póor are devóured by the príde of the wícked;
they are cáught in the schémes that óthers have máde.

3 For the wícked bóasts of his sóul’s desíres;
the cóvetous blasphémes and spúrns the Lórd.
4 The wicked sáys in his príde, “Gód will not púnish.
There ís no Gód.” Súch are his thóughts.

5 His páth is éver untróubled;
your júdgments are on hígh, far remóved.
All thóse who oppóse him, he derídes.
6 In his héart he thinks, “Néver shall I fálter;
néver shall misfórtune be my lót.”

7 His móuth is full of cúrsing, gúile, oppréssion;
únder his tóngue are decéit and évil.
8 He síts in ámbush in the víllages;
in hidden pláces, he múrders the ínnocent.

The éyes of the wícked keep wátch for the hélpless.
9 He lúrks in híding like a líon in his láir;
he lúrks in híding to séize the póor;
he séizes the póor one and drágs him awáy.

10 He cróuches, prepáring to spríng,
and the hélpless fall préy to his stréngth.
11 He sáys in his héart, “God forgéts,
he hides his fáce, néver will he sée.”

12 Arise, O Lórd; lift up your hánd, O Gód!
Do nót forgét the póor!
13 Whý should the wícked spurn Gód,
saying in his héart, “You will not cáll to accóunt”?

14 But you have séen the tróuble and sórrow.
You nóte it; you táke it in your hánds.
The hélpless one relíes on yóu,
for yóu are the hélper of the órphan.

15 Break the árm of the wícked and the sínner!
Pursue their wíckedness till nóthing remáins!
16 The Lord is kíng foréver and éver.
The nátions shall pérish from his lánd.

17 O Lórd, you have héard the desíre of the póor.
You stréngthen their héarts; you túrn your éar
18 to gíve right júdgment for the órphan and oppréssed,
so that nó one on éarth may strike térror agáin.
