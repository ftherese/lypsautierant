Psalm 64

2 Hear, O Gód, the vóice of my compláint;
guard my lífe from dréad of the fóe.
3 From the assémbly of the wícked, híde me,
from the thróng of thóse who do évil.

4 They shárpen their tóngues like swórds.
They áim bitter wórds like árrows,
5 to shóot at the ínnocent from ámbush,
shooting súddenly and féarlessly.

6 Holding fírm in their évil cóurse,
they conspíre to lay sécret snáres.
They sáy, ``Whó will sée us?
7 Who can séarch out our crímes?"

They have hátched their wícked plóts,
and bróught them to perféction.
How profóund the dépths of the héart!

8 Gód will shóot them with his árrow,
and déal them súdden wóunds.
9 Their ówn tongue bríngs them to rúin;
all who sée them sháke their héads.

10 Thén will áll be afráid;
they will téll what Gód has dóne.
Théy will pónder God’s déeds.
11 The júst one will rejóice in the Lórd;
and flý to hím for réfuge.
All úpright héarts will glóry.
