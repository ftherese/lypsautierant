Psalm 64

2 Hear, O God, the voice of my complaint;
guard my life from dread of the foe.
3 From the assembly of the wicked, hide me,
from the throng of those who do evil.

4 They sharpen their tongues like swords.
They aim bitter words like arrows,
5 to shoot at the innocent from ambush,
shooting suddenly and fearlessly.

6 Holding firm in their evil course,
they conspire to lay secret snares.
They say, “Who will see us?
7 Who can search out our crimes?”

They have hatched their wicked plots,
and brought them to perfection.
How profound the depths of the heart!

8 God will shoot them with his arrow,
and deal them sudden wounds.
9 Their own tongue brings them to ruin;
all who see them shake their heads.

10 Then will all be afraid;
they will tell what God has done.
They will ponder God’s deeds.
11 The just one will rejoice in the Lord;
and fly to him for refuge.
All upright hearts will glory.
