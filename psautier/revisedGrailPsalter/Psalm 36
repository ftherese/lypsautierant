Psalm 36

2 Transgréssion spéaks to the sínner
in the dépths of his héart.
There ís no féar of Gód
befóre his éyes.

3 In his own éyes, he flátters himsélf,
not to sée and detést his own guílt.
4 The wórds of his móuth are míschief and decéit.
He has céased to be prúdent and do góod.

5 In béd he plóts iníquity.
He sets his fóot on évery wicked wáy;
no évil does hé rejéct.

6 Your mércy, Lord, réaches to héaven,
your trúth to the clóuds.
7 Your jústice is líke God’s móuntains;
like the great déep, your jústice.
Both man and béast you sáve, O Lórd.

8 How précious is your mércy, O Gód!
The chíldren of mén seek shélter 
in the shádow of your wíngs.

9 They féast on the ríches of your hóuse;
you give them drínk from the stréam of your delíght.
10 For with yóu is the fóuntain of lífe,
and in your líght we see líght.

11 Maintain your mércy for thóse who knów you,
your saving jústice to úpright héarts.
12 Let the fóot of the próud not tréad on me
nor the hánd of the wícked drive me óut.
13 Thére have the évildoers fállen;
flung dówn, unáble to ríse!
