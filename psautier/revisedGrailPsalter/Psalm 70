Psalm 70

2 O Gód, cóme to my assístance;
O Lórd, make háste to hélp me!
3 Lét there be sháme and confúsion
on thóse who séek my lífe.

O lét them turn báck in confúsion,
who delíght in my hárm;
4 let them retréat, cóvered with sháme,
who jéer at me and móck.

5 O lét there be rejóicing and gládness
for áll who séek you.
Let them sáy forever, ``Gód is gréat,"
who lóve your saving hélp.

6 As for mé, wrétched and póor,
hasten to mé, O Gód.
Yóu are my réscuer, my hélp;
O Lórd, do not deláy.
