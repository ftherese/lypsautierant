Psalm 70

2 O God, come to my assistance;
O Lord, make haste to help me!
3 Let there be shame and confusion
on those who seek my life.

O let them turn back in confusion,
who delight in my harm;
4 let them retreat, covered with shame,
who jeer at me and mock.

5 O let there be rejoicing and gladness
for all who seek you.
Let them say forever, ``God is great,"
who love your saving help.

6 As for me, wretched and poor,
hasten to me, O God.
You are my rescuer, my help;
O Lord, do not delay.
