Psalm 141

1 I have called to you, LORD; hasten to help me!
Hear my voice when I cry to you.
2 Let my prayer be accepted as incense before you,
the raising of my hands like an evening oblation.

3 Set, O LORD, a guard on my mouth;
keep watch at the door of my lips!
4 Do not turn my heart to things that are evil,
to wicked deeds with those who are sinners.

Never allow me to share in their feasting.
5 If a good man strikes me it is kindness;
but let the oil of the wicked not anoint my head.
Let my prayer be ever against their malice.

6 If they fall into the merciless hands of their judges,
they will grasp how kind are my words.
7 As clods of earth plowed up on the ground,
so their bones were strewn at the mouth of the grave.

8 To you my eyes are turned, O LORD, my LORD.
In you I take refuge; spare my soul!
9 From the trap they have laid for me, keep me safe;
keep me from the snares of those who do evil.

10 Let the wicked together fall into their traps,
while I pursue my way unharmed.
