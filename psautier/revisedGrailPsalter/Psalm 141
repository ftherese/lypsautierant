Psalm 141

1 I have cálled to you, LÓRD; hásten to hélp me!
Héar my vóice when I crý to yóu.
2 Let my práyer be accépted as íncense befóre you,
the ráising of my hánds like an évening oblátion.

3 Sét, O LÓRD, a guárd on my móuth;
keep wátch at the dóor of my líps!
4 Do not túrn my héart to thíngs that are évil,
to wícked déeds with thóse who are sínners.

Néver allów me to sháre in their féasting.
5 If a góod man stríkes me it is kíndness;
but let the óil of the wícked not anóint my héad.
Let my práyer be éver agáinst their málice.

6 If they fáll into the mérciless hánds of their júdges,
théy will grásp how kínd are my wórds.
7 As clóds of éarth plowed úp on the gróund,
so their bónes were stréwn at the móuth of the gráve.

8 To you my éyes are túrned, O LÓRD, my LÓRD.
In yóu I take réfuge; spáre my sóul!
9 From the tráp they have láid for me, kéep me sáfe;
kéep me from the snáres of thóse who do évil.

10 Let the wicked togéther fáll into their tráps,
while Í pursúe my wáy unhármed.
