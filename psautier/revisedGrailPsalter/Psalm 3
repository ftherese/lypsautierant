Psalm 3

2 How mány are my fóes, O Lórd!
How mány are rísing up agáinst me!
3 How mány are sáying abóut me,
"There is no salvátion for hím in Gód."
4 But yóu, Lord, are a shíeld abóut me, 
my glóry, who líft up my héad.
5 I crý alóud to the Lórd.
From his hóly móuntain he ánswers me.

6 I lie dówn, I sléep and I wáke,
for the Lórd uphólds me.
7 I will not féar even thóusands of péople
who are ránged on every síde agáinst me.

Aríse, Lord; sáve me, my Gód,
8 you who stríke all my fóes on the chéek,
you who bréak the téeth of the wícked!
9 Salvátion belóngs to the Lórd;
may your bléssing bé on your péople!
