Psalm 97

1 The Lord is kíng, let éarth rejóice;
let the mány íslands be glád.
2 Clóud and dárkness surróund him;
justice and ríght are the foundátion of his thróne.

3 A fíre prepáres his páth;
it búrns up his fóes on every síde.
4 His líghtnings líght up the wórld;
the éarth looks ón and trémbles.

5 The móuntains mélt like wáx 
befóre the fáce of the Lórd,
before the fáce of the Lórd of all the éarth.
6 The skíes procláim his jústice;
all péoples sée his glóry.

7 Let thóse who serve ídols be ashámed,
those who bóast of their wórthless góds.
All you ángels, wórship him.
8 Sion héars and is glád;
the dáughters of Júdah rejóice
becáuse of your júdgments, O Lórd.

9 For yóu indéed are the Lórd,
most hígh above áll the éarth,
exálted fár above all góds.

10 The Lórd loves thóse who hate évil;
he guárds the sóuls of his fáithful;
he séts them frée from the wícked.

11 Líght shines fórth for the júst one,
and jóy for the úpright of héart.
12 Rejóice in the Lórd, you júst;
to the mémory of his hóliness give thánks.
