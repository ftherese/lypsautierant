Psalm 27

1 The Lórd is my líght and my salvátion;
whóm shall I féar?
The Lórd is the strónghold of my lífe;
whóm should I dréad?

2 When thóse who do évil draw néar
to devóur my flésh,
it is théy, my énemies and fóes,
who stúmble and fáll.

3 Though an ármy encámp agáinst me,
my héart would not féar.
Though wár break óut agáinst me,
even thén would I trúst.

4 There is óne thing I ásk of the Lórd,
only thís do I séek:
to líve in the hóuse of the Lórd
all the dáys of my lífe,
to gáze on the béauty of the Lórd,
to inqúire at his témple.

5 For thére he keeps me sáfe in his shélter
in the dáy of évil.
He hídes me under cóver of his tént;
he sets me hígh upon a róck.

6 And nów my héad shall be ráised
above my fóes who surróund me,
and I shall óffer withín his tént
a sácrifice of jóy.
I will síng and make músic for the Lórd.

7 O Lórd, hear my vóice when I cáll;
have mércy and ánswer me.
8 Of yóu my héart has spóken,
``Séek his fáce."

It is your fáce, O Lórd, that I séek;
9 hide not your fáce from mé.
Dismíss not your sérvant in ánger;
yóu have been my hélp.

Dó not abándon or forsáke me,
O Gód, my Sávior!
10  Though fáther and móther forsáke me,
the Lórd will recéive me.

11 Instrúct me, Lórd, in your wáy;
on an éven path léad me
becáuse of my énemies.
12 Do not léave me to the wíll of my fóes,
for false wítnesses rise úp agáinst me,
and they bréathe out víolence.

13 I belíeve I shall sée the Lord’s góodness
in the lánd of the líving.
14 Wáit for the Lórd; be stróng;
be stouthéarted, and wáit for the Lórd!
