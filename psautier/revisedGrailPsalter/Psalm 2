Psalm 2

1 Whý do the nátions conspíre,
and the péoples plót in váin?
2 They aríse, the kíngs of the éarth;
princes plót against the Lórd and his Anóinted.
3 “Let us búrst asúnder their fétters.
Let us cást off from ús their cháins.”

4 He who síts in the héavens láughs;
the Lórd derídes and mócks them.
5 Thén he will spéak in his ánger,
his ráge will stríke them with térror.
6 “It is Í who have appóinted my kíng
on Síon, my hóly móuntain.”

7 I will annóunce the decrée of the Lórd:
The Lord sáid to me, “Yóu are my Són.
It is Í who have begótten you this dáy.

8 Ásk of me and Í will gíve you
the nátions as yóur inhéritance,
and the énds of the éarth as your posséssion.
9 With a ród of íron you will rúle them;
like a pótter’s jár you will shátter them.”

10 So nów, O kíngs, understánd;
take wárning, rúlers of the éarth.
11 Sérve the Lórd with féar;
exult with trémbling, páy him your hómage,
12 lest he be ángry and you pérish on the wáy,
for súddenly his ánger will bláze.

Bléssed are áll
who trust in Gód!
