Psalm 103

1 Bléss the Lórd, O my sóul,
and all withín me, his hóly náme.
2 Bléss the Lórd, O my sóul,
and néver forgét all his bénefits.

3 It is the Lórd who forgíves all your síns,
who héals every óne of your ílls,
4 who redéems your lífe from the gráve,
who crówns you with mércy and compássion,
5 who fílls your lífe with good thíngs,
renéwing your yóuth like an éagle’s.

6 The Lórd does júst déeds,
gives full jústice to áll who are oppréssed.
7 He made knówn his wáys to Móses,
and his déeds to the chíldren of Ísrael.

8 The Lórd is compássionate and grácious,
slow to ánger and rích in mércy.
9 Hé will not álways find fáult;
nor persíst in his ánger foréver.
10 He does not tréat us accórding to our síns,
nor repáy us accórding to our fáults.

11 For as the héavens are hígh above the éarth,
so strong his mércy for thóse who féar him.
12 As fár as the éast is from the wést,
so far from ús does he remóve our transgréssions.

13 As a fáther has compássion on his chíldren,
the Lord’s compássion is on thóse who féar him.
14 For he knóws of whát we are máde;
he remémbers that wé are dúst.

15 Mán, his dáys are like gráss;
he flówers like the flówer of the fíeld.
16 The wind blóws, and it ís no móre,
and its pláce never sées it agáin.

17 But the mércy of the Lórd is everlásting
upon thóse who hóld him in féar,
upon chíldren’s chíldren his jústice,
18 for thóse who kéep his cóvenant,
and remémber to fulfíll his commánds.

19 The Lord has fíxed his thróne in héaven,
and his kíngdom is rúling over áll.
20  Bless the Lórd, all yóu his ángels,
mighty in pówer, fulfílling his wórd,
who héed the vóice of his wórd.

21 Bléss the Lórd, all his hósts,
his sérvants, who dó his wíll.
22 Bléss the Lórd, all his wórks,
in évery pláce where he rúles.
Bléss the Lórd, O my sóul!
