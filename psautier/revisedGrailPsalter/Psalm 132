Psalm 132

1 O LORD, remember David
and all the hardships he endured,
2 the oath he swore to the LORD,
his vow to the Strong One of Jacob.

3 “I will not enter my house,
nor go to the bed where I rest;
4 I will give no sleep to my eyes,
to my eyelids I will give no slumber,
5 till I find a place for the LORD,
a dwelling for the Strong One of Jacob.”

6 At Ephrata we heard of it;
we found it in the plains of Yearim.
7 “Let us go to the place of his dwelling;
let us bow down at his footstool.”

8 Go up, LORD, to the place of your rest,
you and the ark of your strength.
9 Your priests shall be clothed with justice;
your faithful shall ring out their joy.
10 For the sake of David your servant,
do not reject your anointed.

11 The LORD swore an oath to David;
he will not go back on his word:
“A son, the fruit of your body,
will I set upon your throne.

12 If your sons hold fast to my covenant,
and my laws that I have taught them,
their sons, in turn, shall sit
on your throne from age to age.”

13 For the LORD has chosen Sion;
he has desired it for his dwelling:
14 “This is my resting place from age to age;
here have I chosen to dwell.

15 I will greatly bless her produce;
I will fill her poor with bread.
16 I will clothe her priests with salvation,
and her faithful shall ring out their joy.

17 I will make a stock sprout up for David;
I will prepare a lamp for my anointed.
18 I will cover his enemies with shame,
but on him my crown shall shine.”
