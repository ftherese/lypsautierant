Psalm 87

1 Founded by hím on the hóly móuntain,
2 the Lórd loves the gátes of Síon,
more than áll the dwéllings of Jácob.
3 Of yóu are told glórious thíngs,
yóu, O cíty of Gód!

4 ``Rahab and Bábylon Í will cóunt
among thóse who knów me;
of Tyre, Philístia, Ethiópia, it is tóld,
‘There was thís one bórn.’
5 But of Síon it sháll be sáid,
‘Each one was bórn in hér.’"

Hé, the Most Hígh, estáblished it.
6 In his régister of péoples the Lord wrítes,
``Hére was thís one bórn."
7 The síngers cry óut in chórus,
``In yóu, all fínd their hóme."
