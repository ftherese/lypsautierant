Psalm 100

1 Cry out with joy to the Lord, all the earth.
2 Serve the Lord with gladness.
Come before him, singing for joy.

3 Know that he, the Lord, is God.
He made us; we belong to him.
We are his people, the sheep of his flock.

4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving
and his courts with songs of praise.
Give thanks to him, and bless his name.

5 Indeed, how good is the Lord,
eternal his merciful love.
He is faithful from age to age.

Now and forever. Amen.
