Psalm 116B

10 I trusted, even when I said,
“I am sorely afflicted,”
11 and when I said in my alarm,
“These people are all liars.”

12 How can I repay the LORD
for all his goodness to me?
13 The cup of salvation I will raise;
I will call on the name of the LORD.

14 My vows to the LORD I will fulfill
before all his people.
15 How precious in the eyes of the LORD
is the death of his faithful.

16 Your servant, LORD, your servant am I,
the son of your handmaid;
you have loosened my bonds.
17 A thanksgiving sacrifice I make;
I will call on the name of the LORD.

18 My vows to the LORD I will fulfill
before all his people,
19 in the courts of the house of the LORD,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.

Alleluia!
