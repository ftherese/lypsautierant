Psalm 116B

10 I trústed, éven when I sáid,
``I am sórely afflícted,"
11 and whén I sáid in my alárm,
``These péople are all líars."

12 Hów can I repáy the LÓRD
for áll his góodness to mé?
13 The cúp of salvátion I will ráise;
I will cáll on the náme of the LÓRD.

14 My vóws to the LÓRD I will fulfíll
before áll his péople.
15 How précious in the éyes of the LÓRD
is the déath of his fáithful.

16 Your sérvant, LORD, your sérvant am Í,
the són of your hándmaid;
you have lóosened my bónds.
17 A thánksgiving sácrifice I máke;
I will cáll on the náme of the LÓRD.

18 My vóws to the LÓRD I will fulfíll
before áll his péople,
19 in the cóurts of the hóuse of the LÓRD,
in your mídst, O Jerúsalem.

Alleluia!
