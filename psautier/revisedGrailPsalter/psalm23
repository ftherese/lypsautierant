Psalm 23

1 The Lord is my shepherd;
there is nothing I shall want.
2 Fresh and green are the pastures
where he gives me repose.
Near restful waters he leads me;
3 he revives my soul.

He guides me along the right path,
for the sake of his name.
4 Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death,
no evil would I fear, for you are with me.
Your crook and your staff will give me comfort.

5 You have prepared a table before me
in the sight of my foes.
My head you have anointed with oil;
my cup is overflowing.

6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life.
In the Lordâ€™s own house shall I dwell
for length of days unending.

Now and forever. Amen.
