Psalm 150

1 Alleluia!

Praise Gód in his hóly pláce;
práise him in his míghty fírmament.
2 Práise him for his pówerful déeds;
práise him for his bóundless grándeur.

3 O práise him with sóund of trúmpet;
práise him with lúte and hárp.
4 Práise him with tímbrel and dánce;
práise him with stríngs and pípes.

5 O práise him with resóunding cýmbals;
práise him with cláshing of cýmbals.
6 Let éverything that bréathes praise the LÓRD!

Alleluia!
