Psalm 150

1 Alleluia!

Praise God in his holy place;
praise him in his mighty firmament.
2 Praise him for his powerful deeds;
praise him for his boundless grandeur.

3 O praise him with sound of trumpet;
praise him with lute and harp.
4 Praise him with timbrel and dance;
praise him with strings and pipes.

5 O praise him with resounding cymbals;
praise him with clashing of cymbals.
6 Let everything that breathes praise the LORD!

Alleluia!
