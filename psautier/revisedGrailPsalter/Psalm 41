Psalm 41

2 Blessed is hé who has concérn for the póor.
In time of tróuble, the Lórd will réscue him.

3 The Lórd will guárd him, give him lífe,
and máke him bléssed in the lánd,
not give him úp to the wíll of his fóes.

4 The Lord will hélp him on his béd of páin;
you will bríng him back from síckness to héalth.

5 As for mé, I said, ``Lórd, have mércy on mé;
héal my sóul, for I have sínned agáinst you."
6 My fóes are spéaking évil agáinst me:
``How lóng before he díes, and his náme be forgótten?"
7 When someone cómes to vísit me, he spéaks empty wórds;
his héart stores up málice; on léaving, he spreads líes.

8 All my foes whísper togéther agáinst me;
they devíse evil plóts agáinst me:
9 ``Something déadly has fástened upón him;
he will not ríse from whére he líes."

10 Thus éven my fríend, in whom I trústed,
who áte my bréad,
has lífted his héel agáinst me.

11 But yóu, O Lórd, have mércy on mé.
Raise me úp and Í will repáy them.
12 By thís I knów your fávor:
that my fóes do not tríumph over mé.
13 In my intégrity yóu have uphéld me,
and have sét me in your présence foréver.

[14] Blést be the Lórd, the Gód of Ísrael,
from áge to áge. Amén. Amén.
