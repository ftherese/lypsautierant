Psalm 41

2 Blessed is he who has concern for the poor.
In time of trouble, the Lord will rescue him.

3 The Lord will guard him, give him life,
and make him blessed in the land,
not give him up to the will of his foes.

4 The Lord will help him on his bed of pain;
you will bring him back from sickness to health.

5 As for me, I said, “Lord, have mercy on me;
heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.”
6 My foes are speaking evil against me:
“How long before he dies, and his name be forgotten?”
7 When someone comes to visit me, he speaks empty words;
his heart stores up malice; on leaving, he spreads lies.

8 All my foes whisper together against me;
they devise evil plots against me:
9 “Something deadly has fastened upon him;
he will not rise from where he lies.”

10 Thus even my friend, in whom I trusted,
who ate my bread,
has lifted his heel against me.

11 But you, O Lord, have mercy on me.
Raise me up and I will repay them.
12 By this I know your favor:
that my foes do not triumph over me.
13 In my integrity you have upheld me,
and have set me in your presence forever.

[14] Blest be the Lord, the God of Israel,
from age to age. Amen. Amen.
