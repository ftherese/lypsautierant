Psalm 4(4) Cum invocarem

2 When I call, answer me, O God of justice;
from anguish you released me, have mercy and hear me!

3 O men, how long will your hearts be closed,
will you love what is futile and seek what is false?

4 It is the Lord who grants favors to those whom he loves;
the Lord hears me whenever I call him.

5 Fear him; do not sin: ponder on your bed and be still
6 Make justice your sacrifice, and trust in the Lord.

7 "What can bring us happiness?" many say.
Lift up the light of your face on us, O Lord.

8 You have put into my heart a greater joy
than they have from abundance of corn and new wine.

9 I will lie down in peace and sleep comes at once
for you alone, Lord, make me dwell in safety.
